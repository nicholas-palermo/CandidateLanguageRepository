‚û°Ô∏èDoubles the IRS to go after YOU! I voted NO! #NY11Debate
Under one party rule, Democrats have fueled inflation, weakened our national security and made our communities less safe. 

It‚Äôs time to restore balance at the city, state, and federal level &amp; get our country back on track!
Thousands of convicts &amp; dozens of people on the terror watchlist have been caught attempting to enter our country. Max Rose voted AGAINST deporting those who commit crimes or pose a national security risk. He even supported de Blasio‚Äôs sanctuary for criminals policy. #NY11Debate
While Max Rose marched with those chanting ‚ÄúDefund the Police‚Äù &amp; then voted to strip resources and qualified immunity for police officers across America, I have backed our law enforcement, been endorsed by every NYPD union &amp; secured millions in funding for our police. #NY11Debate
