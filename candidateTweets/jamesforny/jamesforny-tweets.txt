We will keep working tirelessly to turn the tide on the opioid epidemic and prevent future devastation.
#BREAKING: I co-led a nationwide group of AGs to secure over $3 billion from @Walmart for failing to regulate opioid prescriptions and fueling the opioid epidemic.

Earlier, I expressed concerns about how New Yorkers could watch tonight‚Äôs potentially historic Yankees game.
¬†
While there is a way to watch the game without paying more, it creates requirements including an Apple ID, a smart TV or streaming device, or Wi-Fi or cellular service.

- Force Trump to pay $250 million in profits made from this fraud.

- Install a monitor to oversee the Trump Org's financial dealings for at least 10 years.

- Bar Trump and the Trump Org from applying for loans from any financial institution chartered in NY for at least 5 years.
- Ban Donald Trump, Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric from serving as an officer or director in any New York business.

- Ban Trump and the Trump Org from acquiring real estate in NY for at least 5 years.
Actions have consequences. Along with referring the criminal violations we uncovered to the U.S.¬†Department of Justice, my office is seeking to:
‚û°Ô∏èUsing fraudulent values to inflate net worth and gain benefits.

Trump‚Äôs annual financial statements included fraudulent values and were used for his own financial gain. 

For example, he saved about $150 million by receiving favorable interest rates based on the statements.
‚û°Ô∏èClaiming he had cash available to him that he did not.¬†¬†
¬†
For several years, Trump reported money in a partnership as liquid cash. In truth, he was a minority owner with no control of the money.
‚û°Ô∏èUsing schemes to increase the values of his golf clubs.

One such scheme was to add an inflated 15-30% Trump ‚Äúbrand premium,‚Äù but then claim that a brand premium was not included on his financial statements.
‚û°Ô∏èIgnoring legal restrictions on properties.

At Trump Park Ave, he valued 12 rent-stabilized units at market rate, inflating the value by 65 times.

At Mar-a-Lago, he ignored development restrictions to claim the property was worth $739 million.

Its value is about $75 million.
‚û°Ô∏èUsing objectively false numbers to calculate property values.

For example, Trump's apartment in Trump Tower is 10,996 square feet.

Yet, he said it was 30,000 square feet to value it at $327 million. A New York City apartment had never sold for that much.
Our suit against Donald Trump and the Trump Org alleges a years-long financial fraud scheme. 

Here‚Äôs how Trump generated false and misleading values on his annual financial statements, which were then used to pay lower taxes, guarantee loans, and get better insurance rates:
Trump's crimes are not victimless.

When the well-connected and powerful break the law to get more money than they are entitled to, it reduces resources available to working people, small businesses, and taxpayers.
We found that Trump, his family, and the Trump Org used fraudulent and misleading asset valuations over 200 times in 10 years on his annual financial statements.

These statements were then used to obtain hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and insurance coverage.
With the help of Donald Jr., Eric, Ivanka, and other defendants, Trump variously unlawfully inflated and deflated his net worth by billions to obtain and satisfy loans, get insurance benefits, and pay lower taxes.

In short, he lied to gain massive financial benefits for himself.
Actions have consequences. We're seeking to:

‚û°Ô∏èMake Trump pay $250 million.

‚û°Ô∏èBan the Trumps from running NY businesses for good.

‚û°Ô∏èBan Trump and Trump Org from buying commercial real estate in NY for 5 yrs.

‚û°Ô∏èWe're making a criminal referral to the U.S. Dept of Justice.

Ending gun violence and the opioid crisis requires action from every angle. This takedown is our latest effort to crack down on these harms and protect our communities.

‚û°Ô∏è$1.2 million worth of cocaine
‚û°Ô∏è15,000 methamphetamine pills

‚û°Ô∏è40 high-capacity magazines
‚û°Ô∏èHundreds of rounds of ammunition
‚û°Ô∏è$120,000 in cash
These 12 individuals moved massive amounts of drugs, but even more concerning, they disguised heroin and methamphetamine as pharmaceutical grade pills.

‚û°Ô∏èHeroin was disguised to look like oxycodone.

In order to address this crisis, we need to hear directly from health care providers and impacted New Yorkers who have experienced these challenges firsthand.

We must shine a spotlight on this issue and explore potential reforms to get New Yorkers the care they need.

Inpatient treatment options are limited and decreasing.

Families can't find adequate services for our children.

Homelessness, incarceration, and more frequent hospital visits have increased.

Shirley Goddard has admitted to stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from a charity she ran, and we're forcing her to pony up.
 
These funds will be returned to the organization and used to help disabled children and adults as they were intended.

As we welcome the start of spring, I'm wishing everyone celebrating the Festival of Colors a wonderful holiday with their family and loved ones.
Lead poisoning is dangerous, and it disproportionately impacts children in low-income communities and communities of color.

I'm proud to partner with @AGKarlRacine and the rest of our coalition to urge the @EPA to take steps to protect our children's health and future. https://t.co/mCWvDQBxam

We busted @Fareportal for using deeply deceptive marketing tactics to trick millions of consumers into buying airfare and hotel rooms.

@Fareportal will pay $2.6 million for its greedy behavior and immediately stop misleading consumers.
Most importantly, thank you @harassment_free and other brave advocates for shining a light in the darkest corners and fighting tirelessly to make these critical protections a reality.

These new laws will go a long way towards protecting people from harassment and retaliation.
Sexual harassment is pervasive, corrosive, and has been a silent barrier for women in the workplace for far too long.
¬†
Thank you @GovKathyHochul and to the bill sponsors for enacting new laws to combat sexual harassment in New York.
I was proud to join @NYSCounties yesterday for its Legislative Conference.

From fighting the opioid crisis to taking on gun violence, and protecting our communities during #COVID19, @NYSCounties is vital to our state. I look forward to continuing to serve New Yorkers together. https://t.co/D5yfPPAvrs
Thank you @NYSComptroller for bringing much needed transparency to this critical issue.

We will continue to monitor nursing homes to ensure the safety of our most vulnerable residents.

Report concerns about nursing home conditions to my office:

https://t.co/L0xCVASYRr
.@NYSComptroller‚Äôs audit affirms the findings my office uncovered last year: the former governor and the DOH undercounted the number of nursing home deaths by as much as 50%.
My office recovered $130,000 for two building superintendents who had their wages stolen by a Queens landlord.

In New York, fair pay is not optional.
Equal pay shouldn't be complicated.¬†
¬†¬†
Equal pay shouldn't be controversial.¬†
¬†¬†
Women shouldn't need to wait a moment longer to be paid equally in any field of work. #EqualPayDay
This hate crime against an Asian woman in Yonkers is horrific, and I'm praying that she makes a full recovery.

New Jersey‚Äôs attempt to terminate this commission is unlawful, ill-advised, and infringes on our joint efforts to protect our shared waterways.

We will fight to ensure this commission remains intact and our communities benefit from its important work.

This commission has been critical to cracking down on crime and keeping our communities safe.
If you think you were deceived by Family Energy, contact my office:

My office has secured over $2 million in refunds for New Yorkers who were tricked by Family Energy into paying more for their gas and electric services.

I will not tolerate utility companies stealing from New Yorkers.
It was an honor to attend @CMBrooksPowers' inauguration to the @NYCCouncil.

@CMBrooksPowers knows how to serve her communities, and I know she going to make the people of Southeast Queens proud.
Two years ago, Breonna Taylor was killed.

Her life mattered.

Gender-affirming treatment is not child abuse.

This dangerous directive will only harm already vulnerable youth in Texas, and while this order has been temporarily blocked, I will keep doing all I can to fight it.

Andrew Schnorr has been arrested for allegedly pretending to be an attorney and defrauding New Yorkers in Buffalo out of tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees.¬†
¬†
I won't tolerate anyone who tries to line their own pockets at the expense of New Yorkers in need.
We sent a letter with 29 advocacy groups from across the country urging the Department of Justice to investigate.

My office will do all we can to fight back against this discriminatory, dangerous order and protect these vulnerable children in Texas communities.
.@TheJusticeDept¬†should investigate @GovAbbott for violating the civil rights of transgender youth in Texas.

Treating gender-affirming care as child abuse will cause irreparable damage to these children.
Florida's #DontSayGay bill is a shameful attack on our LGBTQ+ communities.
¬†
We need to create environments that encourage our youth to know they are free to be who they are, not ones that tell them they won't be protected and supported.

Keep fighting for a more equal society in our nation and across the world for generations to come.
From Emmett Till to the thousands of others murdered, Americans should have never had to wait for lynching to become a federal hate crime.

This legislation is long overdue. https://t.co/dnYKCZ13eg

It was great to be in the Rockaways for the 47th Queens County St. Patrick's Day Parade breakfast!

New York City has the most Irish-Americans of any city in this nation, and I'm grateful to be back in person to celebrate Irish-American heritage and St. Patrick's Day. https://t.co/JPFayzbBXX
The #COVID19 Fraud Accountability Act will give my office more tools to hold bad actors accountable and protect New Yorkers from being taken advantage of by #COVID19-related fraud.

I thank @SenatorMyrie and @nily for their work on this important legislation.
Thousands of New Yorkers have been scammed during the pandemic.

From price gouging, to fake cures, to wrongfully being charged for tests and vaccines.

Today, we're in Brooklyn with @SenatorMyrie and @nily to strengthen our hand to stop scammers in their tracks. https://t.co/4fjuKCY4Wx
We're seeking information from experts and advocates to examine this problem and explore creating new, stronger price gouging rules in New York.
¬†
We will use every tool we have to crack down on corporate greed and protect hardworking New Yorkers.
While New Yorkers are struggling to make ends meet, the cost of goods is rising, and big corporations are seeing record breaking profits. It doesn't add up.
¬†
We're looking into whether these companies are using the pandemic and inflation to unfairly burden hardworking people.
This is yet another shameful, draconian law meant to take us backward.

We must keep fighting to protect the constitutional access to abortion services in our nation.

While we‚Äôre heartened that the judge dismissed the NRA‚Äôs attempts to thwart most of the claims in our case, we are disappointed that the judge ruled against the dissolution portion.

We are considering our legal options with respect to this ruling.
A court has rejected a second attempt by the @NRA and Wayne LaPierre to dismiss my office's lawsuit against the organization.

This decision affirms our long-standing claims that fraud, abuse, and greed permeate through the NRA and its senior leadership.
@PatriciaFahy109 I‚Äôm so sorry, Pat.

Sending all of my love and prayers to you and your family.
We're putting over a million dollars back into the pockets of New Yorkers who bought tickets to @WBT_theatre and were denied refunds when shows were canceled due to the pandemic.

While the curtains are closed on this saga, we will continue to protect New Yorkers' wallets.
28 years ago, Ari Halberstam, a 16-year old yeshiva student, was murdered in a terrorist attack on the Brooklyn Bridge. May his memory be a blessing.

The attack on January 6, 2021 was an attempt to diminish, subvert, and destroy our Constitution and democracy.

For the sake of our nation, we cannot be idle spectators: all those responsible must be held accountable.

Read my call to action:
https://t.co/c0e6SGq8do
Concerted efforts to undermine the democratic foundation of our country must be stopped.

Our Constitution has stood strong for over two centuries, and it will continue to do so today, tomorrow, and the day after that.
Every person involved in this attack must be brought to justice, and our leaders in Congress must urgently pass strong laws that protect the right to vote and prevent any future president from trying to overturn a legitimate election.
A year ago, we all watched in horror as the U.S. Capitol was under attack and an angry mob tried to overturn the results of a lawful election.

As we remember this dark day, we must commit to taking measures to ensure an assault on our democracy never happens again.
For years, @CMAdrienneAdams has fought on behalf of New Yorkers in Queens and across our entire city. I know she will keep leading the way for all of our communities as the next @NYCCouncil Speaker.

As we close the door on 2021, it's been my honor to continue serving and protecting the rights of every New Yorker.

Here's a look at some of our biggest highlights over the past year:
With this victory, my office will immediately push to move forward with a trial to determine how much @TevaUSA and others will pay for the devastation they caused.

I will do everything I can to end the opioid epidemic in New York.
In 2019, I made a promise to hold opioid manufacturers and distributors accountable for wreaking havoc on our communities, and one by one, we've done just that.

We have secured up to $1.5 billion in funds for New York that will be used to fight the opioid crisis.
#BREAKING: A jury has found opioid manufacturer @TevaUSA and others responsible for the destruction they caused Americans by fueling the opioid crisis.

This ruling in our trial is a victory for every family and community torn apart by opioids.
These schemes violated tenants' rights¬†and also¬†threatened students with thousands of dollars in debt.

We will always fight to hold predatory landlords accountable and protect our students.
Monarch's scheme involved:

1‚É£ Coaxing students into signing leases for housing

2‚É£ Denying students access to that very housing

3‚É£ Demanding students pay thousands of dollars in rent for housing they were denied

4‚É£ Referring students to debt collectors for not paying this rent
Monarch 716, a student housing complex, preyed on students at @buffalostate through an illegal housing scheme, and my office is making them pay.

We're canceling over $200,000 in illegal housing debt and recouping tens of thousands for students who were deceived and threatened.
It is essential that any employee who is exhibiting any symptom of #COVID19 and tests positive not be pressured by New York employers to return to the workplace before those symptoms subside.

There's nothing more important to our nation's democracy than the right to vote in free and fair elections.

Congress must immediately pass legislation to defend against voter suppression and attacks on the integrity of our elections.
Last weekend in Syracuse, we had our most successful community gun buyback event to date.

We're going to continue to protect communities across New York and combat gun violence head-on.

The best thing you can do to protect yourself and your loved ones from #COVID19 is to get vaccinated.

Do your part. Save lives. Get the vaccine.
After years of unregulated air pollution from other states into New York, we sued the previous admin‚Äôs EPA to crack down on dangerous smog that harms our communities.

Today, the @EPA is taking action and enforcing critical rules to protect New Yorkers and the air we breathe.
#COVID19¬†vaccine misinformation on Facebook has led to lower vaccination rates in minority communities, especially in Latino communities.

Sexual harassment is unacceptable for anyone, anywhere, no matter how powerful the perpetrator.

Today, we move one step closer to remedying workplace harassment. I thank the women and men who came forward and bravely shared their stories.
Our four-year investigation found that Batali, Bastianich, and their management company, B&amp;B Hospitality, engaged in unwanted sex discrimination and retaliation, including inappropriate touching and other sexual advances.
For years, famed chef Mario Batali and Joseph Bastianich allowed sexual harassment and misconduct in their New York City restaurants.

These funds will go to communities across New York and the nation to help end this crisis.

We will continue to do everything we can to prevent future devastation from opioids.
As part of a historic global settlement, @JNJNews, @McKesson, @cardinalhealth, and @Healthcare_ABC will pay $26 billion for their roles in the opioid crisis.

Up to $1.25 billion will go to New York under settlements we previously announced with these companies.
New Yorkers: The child tax credit is meant to help families with the financial burden of #COVID19, and it's illegal for institutions to try to seize this crucial relief.

If anyone tries to take these funds, contact my office:

1-800-771-7755
Ending this crisis is a priority: In the past month, we also delivered $230 million from @JNJNews and $4.5 billion from Purdue Pharma to hold them accountable for their roles in fueling this destruction.

These funds will be vital to prevent future devastation caused by opioids.
This is a monumental step to provide our communities with funds for treatment and prevention programs to fight this crisis and to hold @McKesson, @cardinalhealth, and @Healthcare_ABC accountable.

Our trial against the 3 remaining opioid manufacturers continues.
#BREAKING: Three of the nation's largest opioid distributors will pay up to $1.1 billion to New York for their roles in fueling the opioid crisis that has wreaked havoc on communities across our state.

This is the largest monetary agreement my office has negotiated since 2019.

From taking on the manufacturers and distributors fueling the opioid crisis to cracking down on those who are illegally trafficking opioids and other drugs across New York, we're tackling this crisis from every angle.

Those who endanger our communities will be held accountable.
We busted a major drug trafficking ring operating throughout New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania.

In our third major action in the past month, 16 individuals have been charged for their roles in flooding our communities with tens of thousands of opioid pills and cocaine.
My office has returned $427K to New Yorkers in Westchester who paid deposits for events that were canceled due to the #COVID19 pandemic.

We're putting $590K back into the pockets of employees of the JFK airline service contractor Eulen America after the company spent years violating minimum wage laws in New York.

All workers in New York deserve to be paid for their work.
Deed theft continues to threaten homeowners, especially elderly New Yorkers in communities of color.

My office will continue to ensure these schemers are brought to justice because no one should have to fear that their homes will be stolen from them.
After an investigation by my office, Joseph Makhani has been indicted for stealing two Harlem brownstones through deed theft and mortgage fraud.

Makhani claimed to have paid only $10 for each home, and they are now valued at $2.29M and $1.9M.
While no amount of money will ever compensate for the thousands who lost their lives or became addicted to opioids, these funds will quickly be used to end any future devastation.

Ending this epidemic continues to be one of our top priorities.
We're holding Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family accountable for their role in fueling the opioid crisis. $4.5 billion will go to prevention, treatment, and recovery programs in communities across the US.

Purdue will shut down and the Sacklers will never make opioids again.
We won‚Äôt allow companies to illegally quash competition so they can make billions.

We are seeking to end Google‚Äôs monopoly power and fight for millions of consumers and small business owners in New York and beyond.
Google has left millions of¬†Android users and app developers with no option but to use the Google Play Store.

This is raising prices for consumers and squeezing millions of small businesses¬†that are trying to compete.
I'm co-leading a bipartisan coalition of 37 AGs in a lawsuit against @Google for its unlawful and anticompetitive conduct around its mobile app store.

This is our second lawsuit against Google in the last six months as we seek to protect consumers and competition.
Since day one, cracking down on violent crime and protecting our communities has been my priority.

Let this serve as a warning: this dangerous, illegal activity will not be tolerated in New York.
We charged 78 people for their roles in these illegal operations and seized about $2 million worth of cocaine, heroin, and other drugs and 15 firearms, including 9 ghost guns.

These communities have been ravaged by gun violence, and we're getting these guns off our streets.
We busted two major drug trafficking rings that have been flooding Central New York with dangerous narcotics.

NWCSD‚Äôs inaction has shown its students, particularly young women, that the very people charged with ensuring their safety will not protect them when they need it most.

We're going to fight for these survivors and hold this school district accountable.
In violation of Title IX and state law, NWCSD deliberately turned a blind eye to the abuse, harassment, and bullying happening right in its schools.

This caused untold physical, mental, and emotional trauma to students, and jeopardized their education.
In 2019, we launched an investigation into the Niagara Wheatfield Central School District for failing to respond to incidents of sexual assault and bullying in its schools.

For years, Roberto Clemente Park in Brentwood, Long Island was used as an illegal dumping site for hazardous waste, which put children and communities in harm‚Äôs way.

This is a critical step forward, but it is not a cure all for the ills that have impacted too many families and claimed too many lives.

We will continue to do everything in our power to protect our communities and ensure that no one is beyond the reach of justice.
The Police Accountability Act will make critical and necessary changes to the law, providing clear and legitimate standards for when the use of force is acceptable and enacting real consequences for when an officer crosses that line.
The centerpiece of this effort is to amend the use of force law from one of simple necessity to one of absolute last resort. This legislation also establishes a new criminal offense and penalties for police officers who employ force that is grossly in excess of what is warranted.
In New York, our laws have essentially given police blanket defense to use force in interactions with the public, making it difficult for prosecutors to go after officers who have abused this power.

Not only is that unjust, but it has also proven to be incredibly dangerous.
For too long, police officers have been able to evade accountability for the unjustified use of excessive and lethal force.

Today, I'm introducing the Police Accountability Act, which seeks to change New York law and strengthen prosecutors‚Äô ability to hold officers accountable.

While I have deep respect for Chief Judge DiFiore, I am the duly elected attorney general and it is my responsibility to carry out this task.
 
The governor must provide this referral so an independent investigation with subpoena power can be conducted.
To clarify, I do not accept the governor‚Äôs proposal.
 
The state‚Äôs Executive Law clearly gives my office the authority to investigate this matter once the governor provides a referral.
Given state law, this can only be accomplished through an official referral from the governor‚Äôs office and must include subpoena power.

Daniel Prude was in the throes of a mental health crisis, and what he needed was compassion, care, and help from trained professionals.
 
Serious reform is needed in the Rochester Police Department and our criminal justice system as a whole.
While I know that the Prude family, the Rochester community, and communities across the country will rightfully be devastated, we have to respect this decision.
 
The current laws on deadly force have created a system that utterly failed Mr. Prude and so many others before him.

.@amazon, we won't let corporate bullies put hardworking New Yorkers in harm's way, period.
When employees reported these safety concerns, Amazon retaliated against them by unlawfully firing and disciplining them, in violation of New York's whistleblower protections.
We found that Amazon failed to adhere to proper cleaning and disinfection protocols, refused to notify employees when colleagues tested positive for #COVID19, and didn't allow employees to take basic precautions to protect themselves from a fatal virus.
#BREAKING: We filed a lawsuit against @amazon over its failures to provide adequate health and safety measures for employees during the pandemic and for retaliating against those who voiced concerns for their safety. 

Amazon put profits over people.
We provided guidance to local education agencies across the state to remind them of their responsibilities to support these vulnerable students and provide them with the tools they need and deserve.

While no amount of money will ever compensate for the pain that countless families have endured, we will continue to do everything in our power to prevent this industry from hooking more patients and causing even more harm.
As a result of today‚Äôs agreement, New York will receive more than $32 million and McKinsey will never be able to perpetrate this type of fraud and deception again.
For over a decade, McKinsey helped fuel the opioid crisis by promoting marketing schemes and consulting services to opioid makers, including Purdue Pharma.

McKinsey helped Purdue target doctors they knew would overprescribe opioids and made millions off of this harm.
#BREAKING: We‚Äôre delivering more than $573 million to communities across the nation that have been ravaged by the opioid crisis and holding @McKinsey accountable for its role in turbocharging this destruction.

We will continue to do whatever is necessary to stop the president from putting politics above the law.
President Trump‚Äôs efforts to pick and choose who to count in the apportionment base of the #2020Census is as illegal today as it was when he made this announcement.

The law is clear, every person residing in the US during the census, regardless of legal status, must be counted.

While we will never be able to undo these horrific acts, we will do everything in our power to hold the Buffalo Diocese and its leadership accountable and ensure this never happens again.

The Trump Organization has stalled, withheld documents, and instructed witnesses, including Eric Trump, to refuse to answer questions under oath.

We are seeking thousands of documents and testimony from multiple witnesses regarding several Trump Organization properties and transactions, including from Eric Trump, who was intimately involved in one or more transactions under review.
Our investigation began after Michael Cohen testified before Congress that Trump‚Äôs annual financial statements inflated the values of his assets to obtain favorable terms for loans &amp; insurance coverage, while also deflating the value of other assets to reduce real estate taxes.
I took action to force the Trump Organization, and specifically EVP Eric Trump, to comply with my office‚Äôs ongoing investigation into its financial dealings.

It's clear that the @NRA has been failing to carry out its stated mission for many years, and today, we sent a strong and loud message that no one is above the law.

Not even the @NRA. https://t.co/TwkD7xXEUQ
In New York, we have a set of laws that every individual and entity must be held accountable to, regardless of its size, influence, power, or wealth.

No one is above the law, not even the NRA, one of the most powerful organizations in this country.
They and board members at the NRA abused their power &amp; illegally diverted or facilitated the diversion of tens of millions of dollars from the NRA.

The NRA has failed to carry out its stated mission for many years, and instead, operated as a breeding ground for greed and abuse.
The four defendants failed to fulfill their fiduciary duty to the NRA and used millions upon millions from NRA reserves for personal use, including:

‚û°Ô∏ètrips for them and their families to the Bahamas &amp; safaris in Africa
‚û°Ô∏èprivate jets
‚û°Ô∏èexpensive meals
‚û°Ô∏èand other private travel
Our lawsuit charges the NRA as a whole and four senior leaders, including Wayne LaPierre, with failing to manage the NRA‚Äôs funds and failing to follow numerous state and federal laws.

These actions contributed to the loss of more than $64 million in just three years for the NRA.
We are seeking to dissolve the NRA for years of self-dealing and illegal conduct that violate New York‚Äôs charities laws and undermine its own mission.

But we also recognize the painful journey we‚Äôve been on for true freedom, freedom that still eludes us.
While this hearing is limited to just these recent protests, this is one small part of a long overdue national conversation about systemic racism, policing practices &amp; about a collective, visceral drive for justice and dignity.

People are desperate to be heard. 

I'm listening.
Most importantly: Thank you to all the New Yorkers who bravely testified yesterday and today. Your stories are critical to our efforts to seek justice. 

Thank you for your courage, for your voice, and for your drive to help this city and nation live up to our highest ideals.
Thank you to our two advisors, former United States Attorney General, Loretta Lynch and @barryfriedman1, Founder &amp; Faculty Director of the @policingproject at @nyulaw for their participation.

Their commitment to fairness and equality was clear throughout these hearings.
We just finished hearing from our 100th witness over the past two days. 

Our investigation of the interactions between the police and the public during the recent protests will benefit immeasurably from the testimony we have heard.

Let me be clear: @NYPDnews &amp; @NYCMayor were invited to testify in this hearing. 

In case there is any confusion, I invite them once again. I'll sit here as long as I need to &amp; accommodate @NYCMayor &amp; @NYPDShea.

Testify so we can include your perspective in this investigation.
Furthermore, the @NYCMayorsOffice was notified about the hearing multiple times, via email and phone, and reminded that the @NYCMayor and NYPD Commissioner @NYPDShea were invited to attend.
On June 15 at ~10am, the invitation was once again shared verbally with the @NYPDnews via the Commanding Officer of the Legal Bureau, who was reminded that the public expects the NYPD to participate.
On June 11 at ~10:10am, a written Public Notice about the hearing was shared with the @NYPDnews via email. 

This email was shared with the Assistant Deputy Commissioner of Legal Matters and the Director of Intergovernmental Affairs for the NYPD.
On June 10 at ~7:40pm, the Commanding Officer of the NYPD Legal Bureau, who has been liaising with our team on this investigation, was informed about the hearing and the @NYPDnews was invited to attend.
I understand the @NYPDnews is telling the press that they were not "formally" invited to this hearing. The NYPD was, in fact, invited on multiple occasions.

This is an opportunity for members of the public and those involved in confrontations to speak directly with our office and better inform our investigation.

Now, we will start to hear from witnesses.
We will hear from dozens of impacted individuals, elected officials, and advocacy groups. 

Due to an outpouring of testimony submissions, we will be hosting a second day of our public hearing -- tomorrow at 11AM.
Today‚Äôs hearing is intended to shed light on how police in our nation‚Äôs largest city have handled protests where what is being protested is police violence itself.
 
It is to hear from those on the ground and those who have made the study of the system their life‚Äôs work.
They took to the streets for both those whose names we say, and those whose names never made it onto the front page.
Protesters took to the streets with a righteous spirit for justice &amp; change, not just for George Floyd, but Amadou Diallo, Sean Bell &amp; Eric Garner here in New York. 

For Ahmaud Arbery on a back road in Georgia. 

For Breonna Taylor, asleep in her own bed in Louisville, Kentucky.
We also must be clear what these protests are about: another life lost in a long line of unarmed Black people killed at the hands of law enforcement. 

And a system that has allowed this to happen time and time again without making fundamental changes.
My office is conducting an independent investigation into the NYPD‚Äôs actions throughout these protests and the policies and systemic realities that inform these actions.  
 
Political protest is a fundamental civil right. One that must be protected against unlawful infringement.

The Trump Admin's SAFE rule is a reckless rollback of national clean car standards that will cause irreparable damage to our environment, the economy &amp; public health at a time when the nation can least afford it.
 
We must protect our progress against climate change: I'm suing.
We are seeking restitution for all New York consumers forced to pay these excessive prices due to Quality King's alleged price gouging.

Instead of protecting New Yorkers from this virus, Quality King chose to prey on consumers to line its own pockets.

Not on my watch.
I'm suing Quality King Distributor for gouging prices of over 46,000 cans of Lysol Disinfectant Spray that New Yorkers desperately needed during this crisis.

Quality King charged retailers over double the pre-COVID cost, forcing consumers to pay up to $16.99 for just one can.
Last week, President Trump said that he can ‚Äúoverride‚Äù states to allow houses of worship to ‚Äúopen right now.‚Äù

The @EPA's Dirty Water rule could cause irreparable damage to public health, safety, and our environment.
 
I'm filing a motion to immediately block this rule in order to prevent continued harm while our lawsuit proceeds. https://t.co/ubdIdnCav6
We reached a nationwide $550M settlement with @SantanderBankUS for knowingly placing consumers into auto loans the bank knew they could never afford to pay.
 
This settlement will deliver over $27M of financial relief to New Yorkers at a time when they need it most.
Americans need access to affordable health care, and this is especially clear in the middle of a global pandemic.
 
That's why I will always defend the #ACA from the Trump Administration‚Äôs relentless attempts to invalidate it and strip away health care from millions.

Now, more than ever, workers in our country need paid sick leave, but the Trump Admin‚Äôs @USDOL is enacting a rule that would restrict #COVID19-based sick leave.
 
I'm committed to protecting our workers &amp; their financial security during this crisis, not denying it.
 
I'm suing.
The company Defense Distributed is breaking the law by making 3D-printed "ghost gun" files available online. I'm demanding the Trump Admin enforce the law &amp; remove them.
 
Ghost guns are very dangerous: they allow people to create unregistered &amp; untraceable 3D firearms from home.
In order to beat this virus, we must provide testing &amp; treatment to all those who need it.
 
We‚Äôre asking the Supreme Court to temporarily halt the rule until this national crisis is over because any rule that threatens an immigrant‚Äôs well-being, threatens all of us.
This rule threatens legal immigrants for accessing health benefits &amp; during a pandemic, the risks of forgoing care are enormous.

Immigrant workers are on the frontlines of this crisis. Deterring them from seeking testing &amp; care only risks lives &amp; increases the spread to others.
#BREAKING: I filed a motion in the U.S. Supreme Court asking the court to temporarily halt the Public Charge Rule.

We are in the midst of an unprecedented public health crisis &amp; the Public Charge Rule only exacerbates the harms of #COVID19 for immigrants and our entire nation.
Today, I led a coalition of 25 AGs urging the federal government to take immediate action to ensure stimulus payments from the CARES Act go directly to families in need &amp; can't be seized by debt collectors.

Too many Americans have lost their jobs &amp; income &amp; need a lifeline.

It's imperative that we stay vigilant when it comes to companies &amp; individuals selling #coronavirus-related products &amp; services over the internet.
 
I encourage anyone with info related to these scam sites to report them to my office immediately:
 
https://t.co/5Te8Xoh9Wq
I sent letters to @GoDaddy &amp; several other online registrars to demand they halt and de-list domain names used for #coronavirus-related scams &amp; fake remedies.
 
These scam sites are not only stoking fear in the hearts &amp; minds of Americans but are profiting off their deception.
Multiple users have tried to sell fake items that claim to provide "immunity" to the #coronavirus or allow people to test for the disease, while others try to over-charge for items like hand sanitizer.
 
These fake products have no place in the marketplace that consumers trust.
I'm demanding Craigslist immediately remove posts that try to unlawfully profit off consumers' fears around the #coronavirus &amp; ensure the company has policies in place to stop scammers.

I won't hesitate to take action against those who use this crisis as a get-rich-quick scheme.

It's imperative that as we respond to this crisis, we also preserve the legal rights of all.

Air pollution from upwind states continues to threaten the health &amp; safety of New Yorkers, yet the @EPA refuses to enforce the law &amp; hold these states accountable. 

I'm joining yet another lawsuit against the @EPA to compel them to protect us from this dangerous pollution.
We sued against the Trump Admin's attempt to restrict NYers' access to Global Entry or any other Trusted Traveler Program because it's political retribution, plain &amp; simple.

As the chief law enforcement officer of NY, I will continue to vigorously defend the laws of our state.
Under these rules, faith-based providers will no longer be required to notify patients of their rights &amp; schools will have expanded religious exemptions under Title IX, giving them free rein to discriminate against students/faculty.
 
I'll do everything in my power to stop this.
The Trump Admin is trying to use religion as an excuse to roll back critical anti-discrimination protections for women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and survivors of sexual harassment &amp; violence.

Religion should never be used as a weapon to pit Americans against each other.
The Trump Admin‚Äôs repeated efforts to increase the requirements for asylum-seekers to seek refuge has endangered the lives of tens of thousands of individuals.

I'm fighting these efforts because the abuse of immigrants should never be used as political fodder.
Proud and humbled to speak at the @nytowns #AOT2020 breakfast this morning.

New York is one of the few states in the nation that bans surrogacy.
 
This outdated law has prevented countless people, especially the LGBTQ community &amp; those with fertility issues, from starting their own families.
 
It's time to legalize surrogacy &amp; support all NY's families.
I urged Congress to get this done earlier this week because it's long past time women in this nation receive equal treatment under the law.
 
I hope the Senate agrees.

New Yorkers will not be held hostage by an Administration intent on restraining the sovereign rights of states, while it simultaneously enacts discriminatory policies across the country.

The Trump Admin is trying to implement rules that would allow them to unilaterally reshape immigration policies &amp; severely limit legal immigration to the US in ways that Congress never authorized.

We're fighting back to stop the president's continued assaults on immigrants.
Despite President Trump‚Äôs attempt to punish NYers for passing our own laws &amp; standing up to his xenophobic policies, we will not back down.

We will resist efforts that cut off our access to Global Entry or any other Trusted Traveler Program &amp; I will continue to defend NY laws.

We found @Starbucks illegally required their employees to find a substitute when using sick leave &amp; if they couldn't, they faced discipline, including termination.

This is a blatant violation of our laws, and @NYCMayor and I held them accountable.

The @EPA is trying to ignore science and strip our nation's waters of basic protections.

I'm leading a multistate lawsuit to fight against these rollbacks because access to clean water is a fundamental right for New Yorkers and all Americans.
The Trump Admin has issued a rule that will bar people, many of whom are fleeing violence &amp; persecution, from seeking asylum in the US and send them to third countries instead.
 
This rule is antithetical to our nation‚Äôs values, and I‚Äôm opposing it.
Our state judicial system cannot properly function with the interference of ICE in our courthouses.

Today's ruling ensures we will get our day in court to fight for justice and public safety for all New Yorkers.

We won't allow anyone to get away with denying hard-working New Yorkers their wages or cheat New York by fraudulently obtaining tax breaks.

For decades, tipped workers have been protected by the "80/20 Rule," which ensures workers spend at least 80% of their work time doing tip-eligible work.

We're opposing the Trump Admin's @USDOL attempt to eliminate this rule which would only deny workers the wages they deserve.
We've secured $16M for NYS from a ring of companies for illegally sending misleading &amp; unauthorized magazine &amp; newspaper subscription notices to consumers across the nation.

The subscription to New Yorkers‚Äô hard-earned money is cancelled for these deceptive companies.

Not only has the Trump Foundation shut down for its misconduct, but the president has been forced to pay the court-ordered $2M for misusing charitable funds for his own political gain.

The @FTC needs to strengthen its rules on digital marketing companies‚Äô ability to collect personal data from children.

I'm taking action.
While Trump's @EPA ignores science, law &amp; common sense by allowing Chlorpyrifos, an extremely dangerous pesticide, to contaminate our foods at unsafe levels, we're urging the court to force them to ban it.

I'll continue to force the EPA to do its job &amp; protect the people of NY.
I'm urging the @FTC to adopt greatly needed regulations to protect consumers against deceptive marketing practices.

Deceptive marketing hurts all of us, and we need the FTC to use their power to stop marketers from targeting consumers.
Too many unscrupulous landlords have gotten away with horrific forms of tenant harassment that put people in harm's way.

NYCHA residents have been forced to suffer through record winters with significant heat &amp; hot water outages and NYCHA has failed to act.

I'm supporting a tenants' class action lawsuit against NYCHA because safe, habitable housing should be a right for every New Yorker.
I‚Äôd like to thank @NYGovCuomo, @LizKrueger, and @assemblymanjoe for helping me to ensure that our most vulnerable tenants will be protected.
From being exposed to hazardous materials to having heat &amp; water shut off, tenants will no longer have to meet an unreasonably high bar to show that they are being harassed.

Instead, we will ensure that landlords will face justice when they subject tenants to unsafe conditions.
For too long, unscrupulous landlords have gotten away w/subjecting rent-regulated tenants to dangerous &amp; inhumane conditions to try &amp; force them out of their homes.

With today's signing of my bill, tenants will have the expanded protections from landlord harassment they deserve.

The judge who ruled to block the Public Charge rule said:

We agree.
My office has taken action to protect against dirty air emissions, chemicals in our food, and pollutants in our water, and we will continue taking action.

New York will not sit idly by while the Trump Admin's @EPA continues to destroy our environment &amp; put us all in harm's way.
Trump's @HUDgov has proposed changes to a rule that could lead to discriminatory housing &amp; lending practices &amp; would make it harder for states to ensure equal housing opportunities for all Americans.

Health care is a right, not a privilege, and the ‚Äòhealth care refusal‚Äô rule will give the privileged the right to impose their beliefs on women, members of the LGBTQ+ community &amp; so many others in NY &amp; our nation.

We're launching an investigation with 49 AGs to determine if Google has achieved or maintained its dominance through anticompetitive conduct.

It doesn‚Äôt take a search engine to understand that unchecked corporate power shouldn‚Äôt eclipse consumers‚Äô rights.
Wishing all the grandparents of New York a happy National Grandparents Day.

We also want to be sure grandparents are aware of the ‚ÄúGrandparent Scam,‚Äù a reprehensible common phone scam targeting senior citizens with calls from fraudsters posing as a grandchild of the victim. https://t.co/XzoyTOFlmQ
Trump's refusal of care rule will impact millions:

A nurse could refuse to give a vaccine

An ER doctor could refuse to care for a pregnant woman whose life's in danger

Doctors could refuse to give patients options they don't agree with

That's why we're fighting to block it.
NY &amp; our 26 member coalition were granted the right to intervene as defendants in the Alabama census case.

The federal government is failing its obligation to represent the American people &amp; Alabama wants to continue down that path.

Everyone counts, so everyone must be counted. https://t.co/bnJD62WJeT
We filed a motion to block the Trump Admin's refusal of care rule so health care providers cannot openly discriminate &amp; refuse care to patients.

This admin's repeated attempt to strip coverage away &amp; deny access to care for millions is shameful &amp; we will continue to fight back.
BREAKING: I‚Äôm launching an investigation into Facebook to determine whether their actions endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers‚Äô choices, or increased the price of advertising.

These energy efficiency rollbacks will cost consumers over $10B in electricity costs &amp; increase pollution.

We're supporting Baltimore City in its lawsuit to hold fossil fuel companies accountable. Polluters aren't immune from state laws.
This program exists for one main reason: to save lives.

Denying immigrant children &amp; families lifesaving treatment without explanation &amp; threatening deportation effectively signs their death warrants.

It's unconscionable &amp; we won't tolerate it.
We're demanding the Trump Admin give answers over the status &amp; oversight of the medical deferred action program, which allows immigrants to apply to remain in the US if they're in extreme medical need.

They won't say who runs the program &amp; are denying immigrants in dire need.
Despite the fact that Youtube &amp; Google knew these channels were geared for children, the platforms served ads &amp; collected personal info anyway.
 
This office is committed to protecting children &amp; we will hold those who put our youth in harm‚Äôs way accountable.

These companies risked children's personal info &amp; abused their powers for profits.
The State of Illinois has joined our lawsuit to block the T-Mobile/Sprint megamerger.

With the addition of IL, more than half the US population is now represented by our coalition.

This anticompetitive deal remains bad for consumers, bad for workers, and bad for innovation.
Despu√©s del #LaborDay, es importante recordar lo mucho que los inmigrantes contribuyen al √©xito de Nueva York y de nuestra naci√≥n.

Con los tantos ataques a nuestros trabajadores inmigrantes, estoy luchando y tomando medidas para protegerlos.

We're seeking an injunction to block the Trump Admin's attempt to circumvent the Flores Agreement &amp; prolong the detention of immigrant children.

Everyone is entitled to basic human rights &amp; we won't allow the Trump Admin to continue this crusade to demonize &amp; degrade immigrants.
52 years ago, Thurgood Marshall was confirmed as the first African American Supreme Court Justice. His words still ring true today:

"Where you see wrong or inequality or injustice, speak out because this is your country. This is your democracy. Make it. Protect it. Pass it on."
States have a right to enforce consumer protection laws, and this includes ensuring student loan servicers aren't preying on borrowers to increase their profits.
 
We're defending Pennsylvania's right to sue student loan servicer Navient to ensure borrowers are protected.

New York has always been and will always be a safe space for all students.
Today we issued two letters with @NYSEDNews to NY schools to support safety &amp; equality for all of our students.

The first letter provides guidance for protecting the rights of students, including undocumented students, to receive an education without intervention by ICE agents.
Gutting controls on methane will greatly contribute to climate change, and the deadly toll it's increasingly taking on us, our families, and our communities.

Extremely saddened to see another act of hate take place in NY.

Let‚Äôs be clear: there is no room for any kind of anti-Semitism in any corner of our state.

If you know anything about this attack, I urge you to contact @NYPDnews.

https://t.co/Fes2Ycg13N
The anti-Semitic video from the Rockland County GOP is deeply disturbing. They must remove &amp; condemn it. Saying that members of the Jewish community are a threat to families, our safety &amp; that they must be stopped is despicable. 

We must all stand together to denounce this hate.
Promises made must be promises kept.

Tens of thousands of Americans were promised Public Service Loan Forgiveness, yet the vast majority haven't received a single dime.

We're calling on @BetsyDeVosED and @usedgov to deliver on this promise to America's public servants.
I dream our nation will come together to realize we have no room for hate and division, and instead unite under equality, love &amp; fairness for all.

I‚Äôm using the law as a sword &amp; a shield to ensure no one is above or below it.

Today, I‚Äôm urging Congress with 46 AGs to reauthorize this act and continue this critical funding.
The Trump Admin wants to stop requiring public input &amp; environmental reviews before taking actions on National Forest Lands.

Ignoring the people &amp; science itself puts wildlife &amp; our communities at risk. These lands are protected for a reason. 

We're urging them against it.
After a 3 year investigation, we've convicted 3 people and 3 companies for engaging in a $3M loan fraud and money laundering scheme in the scaffolding industry.
 
These fraudsters will pay back the millions they stole and cease their illegal operations.

Atalaya Capital Management was funding &amp; assisting Vision Property Management's scheme against aspiring NY homeowners.
 
They'll pay over $2.5M in consumer relief &amp; civil penalties for their role.
 
Anyone who preys on innocent NYers is on notice: we will hold you accountable. https://t.co/orwarRLZNE
Despite insurmountable evidence, the Trump Admin keeps denying climate change is real, putting the nation at risk.

Now they're telling fed. agencies to ignore climate change &amp; greenhouse gas emissions when considering the environmental impact of decisions.

We're fighting back.
"You don‚Äôt get to rewrite the American story; you don‚Äôt get to rewrite our values; and you don‚Äôt get to break the law. We'll see you in court."

Presentamos una demanda contra la propuesta de Trump de prolongar la detenci√≥n de ni√±os inmigrantes, eludiendo el Acuerdo Judicial Flores. 

La detenci√≥n de personas, especialmente ni√±os, en condiciones crueles que no satisfacen las necesidades humanas b√°sicas es inaceptable.
With the signing of our bill restoring the 6 year statute of limitations under the Martin Act, New York can better hold corporate greed accountable &amp; deliver justice for victims of fraud.

unacceptable.

These bad actors will soon only have one call left to make: to their lawyers.
Everyone in this nation ‚Äì regardless of legal status ‚Äì has the right to due process under the U.S. Constitution.
 
We're fighting back to ensure that every person is afforded this fundamental right and that this administration does not rip any more families apart.
We‚Äôre challenging the Trump Admin‚Äôs expanded use of expedited deportations of immigrants. The rule would allow @DHSgov to deport ppl without granting them due process protections, as required by law.
 
Millions of ppl, including 4.5M in NY, could be stripped of this basic right.
Black women make 61 cents to every dollar earned by white men &amp; have to work almost 8 months into 2019 to earn the same amount white men did in 2018.
