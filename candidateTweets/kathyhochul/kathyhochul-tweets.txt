‚û°Ô∏è Offering crisis intervention training for police &amp; other first responders
‚û°Ô∏è Creating dedicated inpatient units for those with severe mental illness https://t.co/bz7PUFEvXE
My first priority as governor is to protect New Yorkers. 

Through this strategy ‚Äî adding more cops, installing more cameras, and providing more care ‚Äî we will combat subway crime and keep riders safe.
We're also helping New Yorkers with severe mental illness get the help they need ‚Äî out of the subway &amp; off the streets. 

@NYSomh is launching two new dedicated units at psychiatric centers for these patients.
To keep riders safe: 
- We‚Äôre funding new efforts to deploy more @NYPDnews &amp; @MTAPD officers on platforms &amp; trains

Fringe online platforms radicalized the shooter. Livestreaming platforms were weaponized to publicize and encourage copycat attacks.

A lack of oversight, transparency, and accountability allowed extremist views to proliferate online, leading to radicalization and violence.
As we saw in my hometown of Buffalo, the consequences of hate and division on online platforms can be horrific. 

I issued a referral asking @NewYorkStateAG to examine how online platforms were used to plan, prepare, and publicize the massacre, and the results are chilling.
Here in New York, we're committed to supporting survivors of domestic violence.

While this has been a dark week for our country, we are finally seeing federal action on gun safety legislation that will save thousands of lives.  
 
Thank you @POTUS, @SenSchumer, @SpeakerPelosi &amp; the New York Delegation for their work to get this done.

The Supreme Court is turning back the tides of progress. But New York will always be your safe harbor. Just this year, we:

‚úÖ¬†Signed landmark laws to protect patients &amp; providers
‚úÖ¬†Invested $35 million to support abortion providers
‚úÖ¬†Required insurance plans to cover abortion
NEW: We're launching a multi-platform public education campaign for anyone who may need abortion care.

Law enforcement and military service members need body armor vests to do their job safely. Most civilians don't.

Our bill makes purchasing body armor vests unlawful for anyone not engaged in an eligible profession. All sales of vests will also be required to be done in person.
Microstamping will be required on all semiautomatic pistols sold in New York ‚Äî making it easier to track down perpetrators of crimes.
The gunmen in Buffalo and Uvalde both legally purchased the rifles they used to commit mass murders at the age of 18. So we‚Äôre raising the age requirement to 21 to obtain a license to purchase a semiautomatic rifle.
We‚Äôre strengthening our red flag laws, because dangerous individuals shouldn't have access to firearms.  

Police and district attorneys will be required to file Extreme Risk Protection Orders that block dangerous people from buying guns.
New York already has some of the toughest gun laws in the country ‚Äî but there's more work to do to keep New Yorkers safe.

We are going to strengthen gun laws, give law enforcement tools to prevent crime, &amp; stop the spread of dangerous weapons.

Here in New York, we're confronting the gun violence epidemic head-on.

We're giving law enforcement the resources they need to get guns off the street &amp; keep people safe. 
We'll keep doing whatever it takes to save lives.
We're still mourning the 10 lives taken in Buffalo. Now our entire country is mourning the tragic loss of babies in yet another school shooting.

These tragedies must be a wake-up call.

It's long past time for a nationwide response to this crisis.
Since I formed the Interstate Gun Task Force, @nyspolice is seizing 60% more guns per month than prior to the Task Force. 

This year alone, New York State has seized over 4,100 illegal firearms.
We‚Äôre proud to have the toughest gun laws in the nation, and we‚Äôre strengthening them. 

But it‚Äôs not enough. The strength of our laws do absolutely nothing to protect the babies we just lost in Texas. 

We need Washington to take action.
Right now, in the state of New York, an 18-year-old can buy an AR-15 without a license.

That's wrong and I‚Äôm going to work with the legislature to change that.

New Yorkers came together to save lives. You used the tools, masked up, rolled up your sleeves for vaccines and boosters, and took care of one another.

Because you stepped up, fewer of our neighbors are getting sick and fewer are being hospitalized.
Throughout this pandemic, New Yorkers have shown their true colors: from banging pots and pans to sewing masks to supporting local small businesses.

And our frontline heroes embodied true selflessness, working every day to keep our neighbors safe and our state moving forward.
Today we mark a solemn anniversary: two years ago, we lost the first New Yorker to COVID-19.

The past two years have been difficult. We've lost thousands of family members, friends, neighbors, and loved ones to this virus. We mourn them ‚Äì today and every day.

We are not where we were in early December. New Yorkers did the right thing to get through the winter surge, and we can now lift the statewide mask-or-vaccine requirement for indoor businesses starting tomorrow.

The numbers are clear: we‚Äôre seeing major improvement on the key metrics we've been tracking throughout the pandemic:
‚¨áÔ∏è Overall cases are down
‚¨áÔ∏è Positivity rate is down
‚¨áÔ∏è Hospitalizations are down
‚¨ÜÔ∏è Hospital capacity is up
‚¨ÜÔ∏è Vaccines and booster rates are up
Looking at the seven-day average of cases per 100,000 New Yorkers, we see:
- December 10 (the day we instituted our statewide mask-or-vaccine protocol): 51 per 100,000
- January 9 (peak): Nearly 382 per 100,000
- Today: Under 35 per 100,000

Mask regulations are critical to prevent the spread of COVID-19, make schools and businesses safe, and save lives.

We will not stop fighting to protect New Yorkers, and we are confident we will continue to prevail.
Testing has been a critical tool to keep schools open. That's why we will have already distributed more than 14 million tests to schools by the end of this week.

To continue those efforts, we're planning to send tests home with every K-12 student ahead of the Midwinter break.

Every New Yorker deserves access to affordable housing ‚Äî whether they are at risk of homelessness or simply struggle to pay the rent on time each month. https://t.co/Hj9BmuBIAo
We need to focus on addressing the root causes of homelessness: unmet mental health needs, poverty, addiction, and housing insecurity.

If he hadn‚Äôt taken that leap, and invested in his own education, I would be living a very different life today. My whole family would be. That‚Äôs why I am so focused on expanding educational opportunities.
But what really transformed my family was the fact that my father was able to get a college degree ‚Äì at night, while working at the same steel plant as his father.
Grandpa worked at the Bethlehem steel plant. Grandma worked at Bell Aerospace, making parts for our planes during World War II.‚ÄØ That was their ticket to the life that they came to this country in search of.
My grandfather first became a migrant farm worker in the fields of South Dakota, then later he and Grandma were domestic workers.  And then, it all changed when he heard there were great jobs in a place called Buffalo, New York.
My grandparents fled Ireland as teenagers because they had nothing ‚Äì they were poor, with no hint of opportunity in their home country.
There is nothing more valuable than education and training when it comes to unlocking opportunity and prosperity. It changes lives across generations. I know what education did for my own family's circumstances.
We‚Äôre going to jumpstart our economic recovery by being the most business-friendly and worker-friendly State in the nation.
This pandemic did not create all the problems we‚Äôre facing today. It simply forced us to hold up a mirror and see the cracks in our society that had been too easy to ignore before.
The farmers who supply restaurant kitchens ‚Äì and our own ‚Äì need a lifeline. We're going to support them.
Cheers, New York!

We're going to once again allow the sale of to-go drinks ‚Äì a critical revenue stream during the lean times last year. https://t.co/WctvtA0HXz

We will accelerate a $1.2 billion-dollar tax cut originally scheduled to take effect between now and 2025, so that it all occurs this year ‚Äî meaning more than six million middle-class taxpayers get more money in their pockets now. https://t.co/hYQQppqhM9
The teaching workforce is also stressed and overworked.

We will ramp up efforts to recruit and retain teachers with more effective training and support, faster certification, and stronger career pipelines.

My fellow New Yorkers: This State of the State agenda is for you. Every single initiative is filtered through the lens of how it will help you and your families.
From now on:
We will share success.
We will find common ground.
We will restore trust in this government, because it has been eroded for far too long.
And we will fight like hell ‚Äì not for turf, not for credit ‚Äì but for New Yorkers.
The days of Governors disregarding the rightful role of the Legislature are over.
The days of the Governor of New York &amp; Mayor of New York City wasting time on petty rivalries are over.
The days of New Yorkers questioning if government is actually working for them are over.
For too long, Albany‚Äôs Executive and Legislative branches were fighting each other in the arena. No more. That ends now. I am proposing a whole New Era for New York.
For the first time in New York‚Äôs history, a woman has delivered the State of the State Address. But I didn't come here to make history. I came to make a difference.
Today, we start building a future that the next generation of New Yorkers deserve to inherit. Join me as I deliver the 2022 State of the State address. #StateOfTheStateNY https://t.co/36JQBjfYrV

I've made it a priority to listen to the disability community and provide the resources and support they need to thrive. Proud to have signed this package of legislation to support students with disabilities, their families, and social services providers.
New York will also speed up the process for getting New York City students special education services, expand treatment options for behavioral health conditions, and conduct a new study of autism spectrum disorders.
We're strengthening the state's Early Intervention program so more babies and toddlers can get the help they need to learn and grow as soon as possible.
The four bills I signed into law today will make sure New York kids get the support they need:

New York is on the road to recovery and we're not leaving anyone behind.

We can only recover when all of us recover.
5‚É£ We all know New York is the greatest place in the world, and today we're launching a global tourism marketing campaign to show the world that we are back, and our doors are open for visitors.
4‚É£ Now is the time to think big and give people a reason to come back to New York.

We're announcing a $25M grant program to make sure our convention centers continue to operate as the economic engines they have always been.
3‚É£ We're boosting employment in the tourism industry with a $100M Return-to-Work Grant Program for tourism businesses and non-profits that hire New Yorkers.

This program will help New Yorkers get back to work.
2‚É£ We‚Äôll also help workers whose employers have not fully recovered and can't go back to work, by distributing $100M to workers in tourism-related jobs that have disappeared.
1‚É£ Opening a business is no easy task, but it is someone‚Äôs passion and dream.

But New Yorkers who recently opened their business haven‚Äôt been able to access federal or State relief. I‚Äôm introducing legislation for a $200M fund to help them succeed.
While New York is recovering, too many been left behind.

That‚Äôs why we are announcing a major investment in our tourism workers and businesses to help this critical industry get back on track. ‚¨á

My friends, we‚Äôve been waiting for this day for a long time. In New York State, providers can now vaccinate 5-11 year olds as long as they have pediatric doses in hand and are following @US_FDA and @CDCgov guidance. 1/

The era of neglecting commuters and the community around Penn Station is over. Our plan transforms the crossroads of New York, rights the wrongs of the past, &amp; is forward-looking. 

Together we will create a more livable city for New Yorkers now and for decades to come. 10/10 https://t.co/Kkz7CxmJ8w
North of Penn, 33rd Street will become a major pedestrian-friendly corridor. 
9/ https://t.co/e0hmqOEOwZ
We‚Äôre putting pedestrians and cyclists front and center. On top of 8 acres of new public space, we will widen sidewalks, build new protected bike lanes &amp; bike parking and make other improvements to the streetscape that improve safety. 8/ https://t.co/wTe9p8ExfI
We‚Äôre nearly doubling the entrances into Penn with: 
- 8 in-building entries
- 10 in-building subway entries
- 8 new escalators, 2 new elevators, and widened stairways

7/
A new underground pedestrian concourse will connect Penn all the way to Herald Square, and north to 34th Street. 

We will also require every new building to include new transit entrances, relieving congestion and making catching your train easier &amp; more pleasant. 6/ https://t.co/p6RIcNEXGx
This plan is about supporting our workforce, too. Our plan will create more than 50,000 good-paying construction jobs. 5/
These plans include: 
- Lowering building heights &amp; preserving views 
- Reducing density 
- Prioritizing mixed-use development &amp; permanently affordable housing 

- Adding more space for community &amp; homeless services
