Nicole Malliotakis‚Äô extreme voting record is dangerous for America. She voted to let states ban abortions, prompting abortion bans throughout the nation. She even voted against an assault weapons ban and universal background checks. She needs to lose in November. https://t.co/whalWwzr4x

OUTRAGEOUS: My opponent Nicole Malliotakis says our gun laws are fine and won‚Äôt vote to ban assault weapons.

(2/3) We can fix this easily by letting judges use their common sense and judgment, the very things they were selected for, to determine if someone is a threat to others.
(1/3) Thanks to New York‚Äôs botched bail reform law, we have the worst of two different systems: both the rich and violent individuals can commit crimes and  then walk right back onto our streets as if nothing happened. https://t.co/TznWOtRVLP

In the first 188 days of this year, we have had on average more than one mass shooting a day and a minimum of four mass shootings a week. We cannot let ourselves become numb or complacent to this violence.

Yesterday there was a mass shooting at a Fourth of July parade in Illinois and 21 were shot in New York City. We can‚Äôt let ourselves become numb to gun violence. More funding for law enforcement not less, more gun control, not the status quo. This should not be a partisan issue.

We now know that on January 6th the insurrectionists were armed, had a plan, and Donald Trump tried to lead them to the Capitol despite knowing it was illegal and extremely dangerous. This was an attempted coup.

Another NYPD officer was shot last night. By the grace of God he survived and was released early this morning. But our city cannot just move on from this when we know how much worse it could have been.

White Supremacist extremism is a global issue, not just a domestic one. The Biden administration must treat this with seriousness, and designate these groups as the Foreign Terrorist Organizations that they are.

Let‚Äôs show the country what empathy in our politics can do to heal a community and rebuild our economy. Let‚Äôs show everyone that Staten Island is bigger than any act of hypocrisy, idiocy or hate.
Remember: the small businesses on the brink are not just the backbone of our economy, they are our neighbors. We must pass a COVID-relief bill for them and everyone else struggling - the unemployed, the sick, essential workers, and our cities and states.
As hard as it is, that is what we should do. It is the only way we will fix our broken politics. Presti must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and no one should dismiss the presence of any white supremacy group at a rally. It‚Äôs wrong. Period.
Now, Presti‚Äôs supporters ask to not let white supremacists speaking at their rally or the assault of a law enforcement officer overshadow the pain of other small business owners. They‚Äôre asking Americans to do what they themselves refused to do for those marching for #BLM.

8 years ago Hurricane Sandy ravaged our city and changed us forever. Government promised to be there for those impacted, yet all too often it failed. But we never failed each other. After years of delay, President Trump signed my bill into law to cut red tape &amp; build the Seawall.

This is everything we hate about politics. If it wasn‚Äôt clear before, it is now: the only person standing in the way of COVID relief is Mitch McConnell. https://t.co/9C92hHvJLR
We cannot keep playing politics with state and local aid. Our first responders will be the ones paying the price. They have never let us down, and we cannot let them down now.
We‚Äôve made incredible strides toward taking care of our first responders--from fully funding the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund to getting them much needed resources during this pandemic. But there is still so much work left to do.
Our firefighters and first responders put everything they have on the line, day and night, to keep the greatest city in the world safe. I am extremely honored to receive the endorsement of @UFOA854 and I will not rest until they get the funding and recognition that they deserve. https://t.co/6zzR3OBEmJ

NEW AD: Congress promised to be there for 9/11 first responders, but when it came time to fully fund the VCF, they tried to break that promise. I was proud to help lead the fight, with @SerraRob and so many others, to permanently fund the 9/11 VCF. #CountryFirst #NY11 https://t.co/VuQDV6Rg4F
Everyday, our nurses save this city, state and country. They were there for us. I will always be there for them.
And that is exactly why I‚Äôve fought to provide them the hazard pay they deserve, the testing and PPE they so desperately need. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôve fought to ensure they have the necessary mental health resources -- because our caretakers need care too.
Our nurses are heroes--they always have been--and we need to treat them as such. When I deployed with the National Guard I saw first hand the dedication, the professionalism, and the unbelievable sacrifice our nurses were making each and every day.
I am honored to have @NYNurses‚Äô support. When COVID hit, nurses risked everything to save lives. They are the definition of heroes.

All the meanwhile, @NMalliotakis continues to blindly support her Republican colleagues who are willing to let New York City go bankrupt. The costs of failing to provide relief will be astronomical, and the people of #NY11 will be the ones paying.
Enough with the petty partisanship and Washington games. Our city cannot rise without state and local aid. @DianeSavino, @Michael_Cusick and I are calling for bipartisan federal relief NOW.
Budget cuts will be carried on the backs of our first responders, teachers, and public servants. Hundreds of EMS and first responders will get laid off. Not to mention the service cuts to the MTA and the toll hikes all of us will be paying for.
Failing to provide federal COVID relief will have very real, devastating consequences for Staten Islanders and South Brooklynites. Our neighbors are already struggling to make ends meet, and our small businesses will only continue closing.
We‚Äôre on the verge of economic collapse in NYC unless we get a substantive COVID relief bill passed. I won‚Äôt stop fighting to get a bipartisan deal and am proud to be joined today by State Senator @DianeSavino and Assemblymember @Michael_Cusick to continue pushing. https://t.co/hk9v3coVZ4

The American people cannot afford:

I strongly reject both, because we can‚Äôt afford political games. We need to get the job done.
Even though leaders in Washington have given up -- I haven‚Äôt and I won‚Äôt. We can and must pass bold, bipartisan COVID relief that extends unemployment, supports our small businesses, and yes, provides aid for our state and local governments. https://t.co/XHe9ukyFQ9

My thoughts are with all those who have ever said goodbye to loved ones.
While they were heroes, they weren‚Äôt superhuman. They were young men and women with their entire lives ahead of them, who sacrificed the chance to pursue their hopes and dreams so that we can pursue ours.
Many of them hugged goodbye to partners, parents, and children who never got the chance to welcome them back. Others returned from service carrying emotional and mental scars from the battlefield‚Äîaddiction, depression, or PTS.

What truly makes this a win-win for #NY11 is that the MTA has committed to increase investments for SI and S. Bklyn transportation. Because after decades of being ripped off and forgotten, seeing our commuting costs go up with nothing to show for it, it's time to flip the script.
That will lead to less congestion and more revenue without adding a cent to commuting costs for local residents. #NY11
By splitting the toll, while keeping resident discounts in place, we would get rid of the free ride into NYC that out-of-state trucks have long abused, forcing them to pay their fair share or take a different route. #NY11

After last night's fiery debate, it's pretty clear that there's only one candidate who has the passion, the integrity, and a plan to serve #NY11. All I can say is, you're gonna want to watch the whole thing:
https://t.co/wC72KyfzcN
RT @CricketTimesSq: @chrismccreight @MaxRose4NY @dandonovan_ny Would have loved to have watched the debate, but R train didn't get me home‚Ä¶
Former Rep. McMahon was in office for two years, and brought home $600 million in infrastructure spending. At Friday night‚Äôs debate, @dandonovan_ny criticized him for it. So it‚Äôs no surprise Dan‚Äôs done nothing for 3 years.
"I would have moved here sooner, but I was too busy serving my country in Afghanistan. When I voted in Westchester, that's because I was still serving in active duty and I can't control where my parents live. So let's talk about the issues and stop with this nonsense."
Climate change is one of the greatest threats to our national security, and we don‚Äôt have time to leave it up to debate. #NY11 needs to be protected from the next Superstorm Sandy, and we can‚Äôt wait for a Congressman who‚Äôs in the pocket of Chevron and Exxon to do it.
"First of all we have to admit that global warming is a man made problem. You don't have to be a scientist to admit that."
"Let's get to work on draining the swamp. When Donald Trump said he wanted to drain the swamp he was talking about @dandonovan_ny."
"We have to be a nation of values. And our values are not in line with ripping scared children away from their scared children at the border."
"On one side is Max Rose and the NYPD, and on the other side is Dan Donovan. Anyone who's served on the front lines as I have knows that 21st century policing has to be intelligence driven policing."
The difference between the 2015 version of @DanDonovan_ny‚Äôs positions on immigration and Max Rose‚Äôs positions? @RealMGrimm entered the race and Dan abandoned everything he believes just to win a primary.
"America needs to be a leader in the 21st century. And in order to do that we have got to work with our partners, we have got to have a seat at the table. It cannot be done with vitriol, and it cannot by done by tweeting."
"What is clear with this administration, is that whether you interfered in our elections, or killed a journalist, all you have to do is tell the President you didn't do it, and you'll be in the clear."
"First of all @dandonovan_ny, just to make sure we're on the same page. While they do all gotta go, we're going to start with you."
".@dandonovan_ny voted against this tax bill, but now he wants to take credit for it. This is the kind of Washington DC doublespeak that is the problem with politics in this country."
What is the point of having @dandonovan_ny in the majority if we're going to see increases to our taxes on his watch.
"Because of the GOP Tax bill, we won't have the money for the next depression, the next recession, the next war. Our children are going to have to pay for this, and it happened in @dandonovan_ny's Congress."
RT @JenniferBlatus: Just a reminder that @dandonovan_ny‚Äôs took $$ from Purdue Pharma donors AFTER they plead guilty to charges of misbrandi‚Ä¶
.@dandonovan_ny admits he didn't even show up to the vote to give law enforcement the resources it needs to track down fentanyl-laced heroin because he was at a @ny1 debate.
District Attorneys have tremendous power to lead the fight against opioids. Just look at what DA McMahon has done in 1 term. But for 3 terms, @dandonovan_ny was asleep at the wheel:
üîòDisbanded the Narcotics Bureau
üîòStopped investigating OD cases
üîòSaw 250% spike in overdoses
"If you want to talk about vested interested in this community...what is the Koch brothers interest in this community? What is the telecom industry's interest in this community? You took their money then voted to let them sell our private data without our permission."
"My allegiance begins and ends with the people of this district...Over and over again I've called out the Democratic Party for its failures...Look at what we are doing. There are consequences to calling out the Democratic Party, but we do it anyway because it's the right thing."
We‚Äôre just three hours away from the big debate. Tune in tonight at 7pm on NY1! Even if you‚Äôre not a subscriber, you can watch online on the @NY1 website.

It took @dandonovan_ny 3 years to realize @purduepharma - the company responsible for the opioid epidemic - was bad. 

Those checks should have never reached the bank. How can we trust him?

This is a slap in the face to every person who has had to administer Narcan to save a life, buried their child after it was too late, and to all of those who are still struggling with their addiction.

It's time for @dandonovan_ny to go.

Congratulations to all of the winners of last night‚Äôs primaries! 

Looking forward to working with @MatthewTitone, @Charlesdfall @dianesavino, &amp; @agounardes to win one more on November 6th so that we can give them some backup down in Washington.

With #HurricanceFlorence on its way, @dandonovan_ny thinks this kind of effort is something to be proud of.

If this is how he handles emergency preparedness and recovery, #NY11 can‚Äôt afford to have him in office the next time a storm hits. 
https://t.co/99Sm9saO9c
The gov't was caught lying about the pain and suffering that Hurricane Maria brought upon millions of Puerto Ricans. Now @dandonovan_ny brags about his recovery efforts? 3,000 deaths is nothing to brag about. Failing to deliver millions of water bottles is nothing to brag about. https://t.co/uYNHNyn4aM

This political stunt is an insult to SI voters. We already know the importance of a North Shore BRT and the Light Rail. What we need is a rep. who invests in our infrastructure, not one who rakes in $$ from lobbyists then shows up for the camera during campaign season. #NY11 https://t.co/crCeS0jqeF
Honored to have the endorsement of Assemblyman Michael Cusick, a leader who has been at the forefront of providing solutions to combat New York‚Äôs opioid crisis with his work on the I-STOP program. It's time we gave him some backup down in D.C. https://t.co/LyLfNBB9Dg
Members of Congress shouldn‚Äôt be able to hide behind "Look, that‚Äôs not a federal issue."

How do I know that @dandonovan_ny won‚Äôt do anything to protect #NY11 from Tax Bill 2.0? Let‚Äôs just look at what he did last time: https://t.co/B7VuHULUnV
Prediction: @dandonovan_ny will vote against this knowing it‚Äôll pass anyway then do a victory lap claiming he votes with us 100% of the time. 

But as usual, his no vote will mean nothing - SALT caps will remain, the bill will pass, and the people of #NY11 will get screwed. https://t.co/x3k9hdrzlZ

I'm so tired of politicians following different sets of rules based on the party in power.

Congress exploded the deficit with its tax bill, &amp; now civil servants are being scapegoated. It's outrageous, but @dandonovan_ny won't do a thing about it.
