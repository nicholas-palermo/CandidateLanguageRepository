Our nation needs to be energy independent again and stop relying so much on foreign nations for supply. Ramping up domestic production ASAP would be far better for our economy, security, and environment.

Elected officials must serve the people. The people do not exist to serve the elected officials.
This is not a ‚Äúpandemic of the unvaccinated‚Äù and way too many in government are trying way too hard to instill fear in the population and pit American against American. It‚Äôs not leadership. Far from it! This is the perfect example how a house divided against itself cannot stand.
No More Mandates! No More Lockdowns! No More Fines! No More Threats! No More Firings!

Calm, honesty, respect for all constituents and positive, common sense solutions are welcome. Scare tactics, deception, and punitive actions by gov‚Äôt officials definitely are not.
This isn‚Äôt leadership or science. Early reports on Omicron show that this new variant is causing milder reactions in both the vaccinated &amp; unvaccinated. The WH should stop trying to inject fear &amp; division throughout the US. Americans deserve the respect of HONEST straight talk. https://t.co/Lw0WB9otba
Instead of focusing on positive solutions to fight COVID, many Democrats in government have gotten themselves stuck in a box where all ‚Äúideas‚Äù are related to mandates, lockdowns, threats, fines and firings. Many New Yorkers I speak to have had enough! https://t.co/oNpRAz36Sj

Gov't must better recognize natural immunity &amp; that COVID risks for healthy kids &amp; older Americans are very different, respect freedom, not require people to provide medical information to non-medical strangers, broaden exemptions, &amp; listen to constituents' genuine concerns.
It seems like Hochul is all out of ideas that don‚Äôt amount to a new mandate, threat, fine or firing. The politics should follow the science instead of the science following the politics.
We should be prioritizing access to vaccines, treatments and testing, and investing in R&amp;D for new ideas to fight COVID. People can wear masks if they'd like, but asking small business owners and their employees to enforce Hochul's mandate is unreasonable and flat out wrong.
Early indications, as well as drawing on what we know from other past viruses, are showing that Omicron is causing milder reactions in individuals than previous COVID strains. Unfortunately, Kathy Hochul and Bill de Blasio are using it to instill fear in New Yorkers. https://t.co/tFYt9G7ocb

The most ironic thing about Hochul‚Äôs ridiculous new statewide mask mandate is that less people will want to get vaccinated because they‚Äôll still have to be masked up in NY regardless. I joined @CBSNewYork to discuss. https://t.co/ZWwKZfJkxR
Gov‚Äôt should promote early access to advanced therapeutics over obsession with more mandates, lockdowns, threats, fines &amp; firings. Hochul‚Äôs absurd new statewide mask mandate starts tomorrow. Gov‚Äôt should respect freedom &amp; ensure politics follows the science, &amp; not the reverse.

It is one thing to implement the one-size-fits-all vaccine mandate of Governor Hochul, but harassing, intimidating and abusing dedicated employees, who have sacrificed so much and risked their own lives on behalf of others, is far worse.
In this last example, Stony Brook notified an employee he needed to appear for an ‚Äúinterrogation‚Äù on 10/15, in a letter sent/postmarked on 10/13. The employee did not receive the letter until 10/16, and was not permitted to reschedule the ‚Äúinterrogation‚Äù session.
The hospital is destroying their professional reputations, charging "incompetence", "misconduct", "derelict in your duties" &amp; "insubordination", uniformly denying religious exemption requests, &amp; not providing sufficient notice to appear before "interrogation" sessions.
Healthcare workers who didn't receive the COVID vaccine are being targeted with wildly over the top harassment, far beyond the state vaccine mandate. Whistleblowers have provided evidence of troubling allegations of drastic &amp; unnecessary measures to enforce Hochul's vax mandate. https://t.co/eXoJK9pnvC

Billions worth of US weapons/equipment shouldn‚Äôt have been turned over to the Taliban, the President shouldn‚Äôt have said it was highly unlikely the Taliban would take over Afghanistan (US intel was the opposite), &amp; this withdrawal should have operated more outside the airport.
Bagram shouldn‚Äôt have been collapsed when it was, the military shouldn‚Äôt have been evacuated first the way they were, the Taliban shouldn‚Äôt have been in charge of security outside the airport, &amp; the withdrawal shouldn‚Äôt have ended until all Americans were out who wanted to leave.

Extremely dangerous strategy by the Biden Administration wanting to use ‚Äúeconomic leverage‚Äù with the Taliban to get Americans out of Afghanistan moving forward. This is starting to sound more and more like they are planning for hostage negotiations and ransom payments.
The president and his team clearly are not up to the task at hand, they are trying to operate inside of a false reality of the situation in Afghanistan, and the future is likely to only get worse. Was just on @FoxBusiness with @DavidAsmanFox to discuss. https://t.co/4aGSzGF8WY
Where the heck is the President of the United States?
This isn't about whether to be in a war in Afghanistan. That's a red herring. The issue is the Biden Admin is pushing play calls making conflict more likely, not less. They aren't being bold enough w/foes, considerate enough of friends, or honest enough w/Americans or themselves.
The President &amp; his team clearly are not up to the task at hand, are trying to operate inside of false realities, &amp; the future is likely to only get worse. Our service members, fellow Americans, &amp; allies abroad need American leadership &amp; strength, not surrender &amp; weakness.
From the failed planning &amp; execution of this withdrawal, to the Admin's misleading of the public, the foolish 8/31 date that was erroneously established &amp; should've been moved, &amp; intel warnings brushed aside as inconvenient, I couldn't be more outraged by this historic failure.
The President insisted on requiring Americans &amp; allies to get themselves to the airport, assuring them of a bizarrely optimistic deal with a terrorist group to grant them safe passage, &amp; his admin implied that if they don't make it to the airport then they didn't want to leave.
As an Army veteran, Member of Congress, &amp; proud American, the crisis in Afghanistan is infuriating. It's now being reported that multiple U.S. Marines have just been killed &amp; wounded in this massively flawed exit plan with consequences that were foreseeable &amp; avoidable.

This is a sickening foreign policy and national security failure that history will correctly not be kind to. Every last American must be rescued in Afghanistan.
President Biden should not remain in office. He and his team are just not up to the task at hand and greater and even more consequential challenges will now be ahead as a result. He needs to be removed before further damage is done to American citizens and US national security.
Thousands of Americans are stranded in Afghanistan with terrorists hunting them down. President Biden &amp; his top team are totally not up for this task &amp; it‚Äôs infuriating. I don‚Äôt see how the President can remain in his position. This is historic, unforgivable incompetence.
‚Ä¶and just like that‚Ä¶President Biden is now back on vacation. Why even run for President if you don‚Äôt want the job when it matters most?
President Biden hasn‚Äôt yet taken responsibility in this speech for anything. ZERO responsibility at all for our country‚Äôs epic, historic failure executing this withdrawal from Afghanistan.
What‚Äôs worse than President Biden‚Äôs massive failure executing the US withdrawal from Afghanistan is the very real concern over what he may screw up next at even bigger expense. There‚Äôs an enormous strategic vulnerability exposed right now to the world. This can‚Äôt be unaddressed.
Where in his administration did President Biden get the intelligence estimate that it was "highly unlikely" the Taliban would take back over Afghanistan with the execution of this withdrawal strategy? This contradicts EVERYTHING I had seen and heard as a Member of Congress.
This instant, total collapse of Afghanistan was entirely predictable. This is a historic lesson on the worst possible way to execute a withdrawal. Generations from now, military leaders will be studying this disaster for guidance on exactly what not to do in this situation.
President Biden is taking future US Presidents and military leaders to school on exactly how not to withdraw from a military conflict. He has triggered what is very predictably and very quickly a total, instant collapse of Afghanistan. https://t.co/sJy1Tdwbx8

Voter identification and signature verification should be enacted by every state legislature in the nation. Ballot harvesting and widespread, no excuse mail in balloting should not. Everyone who thinks otherwise is telling you a lot about where they stand on ballot integrity.
Anyone want to guess the top priority for @SpeakerPelosi this upcoming Mon?
A) Promoting Job Creation
B) Uniting a Divided Country
C) Ripping Further Apart a Divided Country By Sending the Senate an Article of Impeachment
D) Working with House GOP to Pass an Infrastructure Bill
Job creation and energy independence are ranking remarkably low on the priority list for the Biden administration. The Executive actions out of the gate are aimed in the opposite direction.
Here's 3 ways @POTUS can reach across the aisle for healing &amp; unity:
1) The Senate impeachment trial should be shut down
2) Address left wing violence. Many of us call out violence on ALL sides
3) Take on Big Tech shutting down conservatives while empowering terrorists &amp; CCP
Energy independence, national security and tens of thousands of jobs come with the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline project. One of President-Elect Biden's first items of business for the day is to kill it of course.
4 years ago, Pres Trump was spot on with his promise to BUILD THE WALL. After Pres-Elect Biden‚Äôs action later today to stop the construction, it‚Äôs clear that one of the necessary pledges of the winning presidential election 4 years from now should be to FINISH THE WALL.

On the same date in the same place as part of the same Constitutional process, Dems made Jan 6 objections after EVERY GOP presidential win over the past generation. The double standard is wild on this one. GOP is tagged as seditionist traitors if they voice Jan 6 objections too.
Wed‚Äôs violence was terrible, but some people need to take a deep breadth and look in the mirror. Those who committed acts of violence in the Capitol must be held accountable, but Dems and media eager to use Wed to settle political scores would only be dividing our country more.
It's an incredible double standard when those who failed to condemn violence in Seattle, Portland, Chicago, Kenosha, DC, NY, etc become holier than thou. Or when suddenly, 1/6 objections used by Dems to object to every GOP presidential win in the past generation is now treason.

ISIS caliphate? Wiped out

Soleimani/al-Baghdadi? Killed

US Embassy in Israel? Moved to Jerusalem

Kamala Harris just said that cashless bail should be enacted nationwide.

That‚Äôs a really bad idea that‚Äôs been eroding public safety in New York since it went into effect statewide January 1, 2020.

The law should be reversed in NY and definitely not replicated nationally.
It‚Äôs a very simple question that Biden and Harris keep dodging: 

If elected, would you pack the Supreme Court? Yes or no?

Just answer the question!
VP Joe Biden opposed the missions taking out Qassim Soleimani and Osama Bin Laden. 

President Obama was right to green light the Bin Laden mission. 

President Trump was right to green light the Soleimani mission.

Joe Biden was wrong both times. Thankfully, he wasn‚Äôt in charge.
The fatally flawed Iran Nuclear Deal was a disaster. The Obama-Biden admin was massively rolled at the table by the world‚Äôs largest state sponsor of terror &amp; Pres Trump was absolutely right to withdraw. Tripping over ourselves to re-enter that agreement would be a big mistake.
The left doesn‚Äôt target @DNI_Ratcliffe because they fear he WON‚ÄôT be good at his job. They target Ratcliffe because they fear he WOULD be great.

The Trump admin last week made a massive $1.6 trillion offer to Pelosi.

Obviously House Dems are going to have to drop some very absurd demands for there to be another coronavirus response bill, such as:

My colleague and friend @RepRatcliffe is highly skilled, prepared and capable of exceptionally serving as the next Director of National Intelligence. He‚Äôs an excellent pick by @realDonaldTrump and our country will be even stronger and safer with John in this key role!
In apparently unrelated news, the Speaker is blocking the House of Representatives from even being in session right now in DC. The Senate is at the Capitol, but the House is AWOL &amp; not even there to hear anyone's testimony regardless of this misfired, partisan grandstanding. https://t.co/qFGH59HIc9
The House of Representatives should be in DC at work right now. There is so much so wrong with the House being AWOL like this. Health care workers, cops, truckers, farmers, grocery story workers &amp; many others NEVER stopped working. It's time for the House to report back for duty! https://t.co/NrqZS1nNZz
Today the US Senate is going back into session in DC. The House is not but should. It‚Äôs time and it‚Äôs not too late for the powers that be to change her mind.

The securing of PPE, ventilators, testing, small business funding, and more during this pandemic has been extra personal for us in Suffolk County &amp; I want to thank @realDonaldTrump &amp; @WhiteHouse for going all in to help us on Long Island. The invisible enemy is on the run!

NY recently pursued reforms to save $ in Medicaid.

The 2nd coronavirus bill that passed Congress had a technical error where if NY enacts reforms saving even just $1 in Medicaid, it loses $6 BIL. That's absurd!

McConnell proposed fixing it. Schumer said no. Let's fix this!
Gov. Cuomo just said the stimulus package could've &amp; should've provided additional support for the NYS budget. 

He is right.

Here's the context not mentioned:

McConnell offered the FMAP language Cuomo asked for &amp; Schumer blocked it, resulting in the loss of SIX BILLION for NY.

CLAIM: Jason Crow just said that none of the 17 witnesses testified as to why there was a hold on aid.

How does he lie so easily? It‚Äôs really quite remarkable. He‚Äôs prosecuting the Pres of the United States in front of the Chief Justice &amp; these lies just keep flowing right out of his mouth.
Jason Crow just channeled his inner Adam Schiff &amp; lied with way too much ease about when Pres Zelensky knew there was a hold on aid. Ambs Taylor &amp; Volker were in direct contact w/ Zelensky &amp; his top aides &amp; confirmed it wasn‚Äôt until after reading it in Politico at the end of Aug.

Schiff can‚Äôt help himself. He just said ‚ÄúDo ME a favor‚Äù in his new parody hypothetical. He refuses to shoot straight. The President never said ‚ÄúDo ME a favor‚Äù. He said ‚ÄúDo US a favor‚Äù. It‚Äôs crazy how Schiff keeps finding new lows twisting the truth with such ease.

Judge Leon set an expedited schedule to decide the Exec v Leg impeachment inquiry subpoena conflict by Dec 2019 or Jan 2020 using the Kupperman subpoena, but Schiff lost interest, withdrew the subpoena, &amp; filed a MOTION TO DISMISS!
Schiff just exposed how much his case has unraveled:

His team claimed just before the trial started that their case was overwhelming, uncontested, indisputable &amp; proof beyond a doubt.

Now Schiff just said he can‚Äôt prove his case w/o obtaining new evidence he doesn‚Äôt yet have.
Jerry Nadler just added John Kelly to his witness request list for this impeachment sham even though he‚Äôs long gone from the WH. Are you kidding me? Who‚Äôs next...Omarosa? Give it a rest! It‚Äôs time for our country to move on and heal from this mess! https://t.co/0bComxlUxH

Schiff &amp; his team have said 1000 times over "no one is above the law", but the articles of impeachment don't even allege a violation of any law. 

There is no impeachable offense &amp; it's not the job of the Senate to go on a fishing expedition to find one.

That's on him.
The lies, leaks, witness coaching, lack of fairness, bad motives, and other forms of prosecutorial misconduct by Schiff resulted in a corrupted, rigged process. It's not the Senate's job to fix the mess that Schiff created.

That's on him.
When Judge Leon offered an expedited schedule to settle the Exec v Leg branch subpoena issue in Dec/Jan using the Kupperman subpoena, Schiff lost interest, withdrew the subpoena &amp; filed a MOTION TO DISMISS!

He was sprinting to impeachment &amp; fell on his face.

That's on him.
At no point of the House impeachment inquiry did Schiff ever subpoena Bolton. 

That was Schiff's play call to declare himself ready for trial when he clearly wasn't. 

Now, he's complaining in the Senate about the many reasons why he can't prove his case. 

That's on him.

The President‚Äôs counsel will absolutely destroy Schiff‚Äôs parody point by point by point by point. 

Game over.

That was the massive downside all along with Dems relying so desperately on presumptions, lies, hearsay and 3% of the story to connect dots not actually connected.
Schiff Claim #9: "Expediency" should not impact the timeline for impeachment.

FACT: Really? After the House rammed through an impeachment because it had to be done by Christmas at any cost, Schiff is going to lecture the Senate on expediency?!?
Schiff Claim #8: Bill Clinton was impeached after lying about a sexual act.

FACT: Bill Clinton was impeached after lying about a sexual act in the Oval Office with a young intern who worked for him. Schiff &amp; the Dems shouldn't be minimizing or whitewashing what happened.
Schiff Claim #7: POTUS was permitted to have his Counsel present during the House proceedings.

FACT: His Counsel was blocked from the closed door depos &amp; open Intel hearings. They weren't allowed in the door until the VERY END AFTER Pelosi announced the House would impeach.
Schiff Claim #6: There was no evidence that the President was concerned about "burden sharing".

FACT: OMB's Mark Sandy testified that the reason he was told why the President placed a hold on aid to Ukraine was that he was concerned about other countries paying their fair share.
Schiff Claim #6: Pres Zelensky &amp; other top Ukraine officials were lying when they said POTUS didn't pressure them.

FACT: That's a disgusting assertion that Zelensky &amp; his top aides are all liars. Their 1st hand accounts should not be rejected/ignored like Schiff is demanding.
Schiff Claim #5: POTUS didn't exert exec privilege during the closed door depos &amp; public Intel hearings bc he would have had to produce docs.

FACT: POTUS' counsel wasn't even allowed through the front door of the closed door depos &amp; public Intel hearings to say or do anything.
Schiff Claim #4: The 1st hand witness testimony of the President telling Amb Sondland he doesn't want a quid pro quo should be used as evidence that there was a quid pro quo.

FACT: The US public is not as dumb as Adam Schiff believes, hopes and prays they are.
Schiff Claim #3: Republicans are not telling the truth when they were saying that there wasn't a vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry.

FACT: Republicans were calling for the vote when there had not yet been a vote. LATER, the Dems had one...weeks into the rushed inquiry.
Schiff Claim #2: 3 of the witnesses at the public Intel Committee hearings were there, because they were on the GOP witness list.

FACT: These were the only 3 witnesses requested by the GOP AND the Dems. They were ALL previously called only by Schiff during the closed door depos.
Schiff Claim #1: He blocked GOP questions of witnesses in the House, bc we were asking "Who is the whistleblower, because we want to punish him?" 

FACT: If you read through all of the transcripts, you will not find that question asked once.
I was on the Senate floor this evening for the #SchiffShow road show &amp; it was hard to keep up with all of the spin, misleading &amp; outright lies. 

Is the media ready to fact check Schiff on any of this or is his nonsense just the media's new Talking Points to blindly adopt?
Burisma is a corrupt Ukraine gas co. run by a corrupt Ukraine oligarch.

The burden is on the government to prove that the President committed an impeachable offense. The burden is not on the President to prove his innocence, especially when no crime was even alleged.
Quid Pro Quo: If you, Ukraine, don‚Äôt instantly fire your state prosecutor, the United States will not give you the $1 billion we promised you.
Schiff and his crew can say ‚Äúno one is above the law‚Äù 1,000 more times until they are blue in the face, but they aren‚Äôt accusing the President of breaking a law in their articles of impeachment.
Worse than the fact House Democrats are unable to prove an impeachable offense is that they failed to even allege an impeachable offense in their articles of impeachment. https://t.co/tTrGsVrwGP
If Crow wanted to talk about the answer OMB‚Äôs Mark Sandy received as to why there was a hold on aid to Ukraine, how does he not disclose that Mark Sandy DID get an answer and it was that the President was concerned about other countries paying their fair share? So dishonest!
Crow just said Pres Zelensky knew there was a hold on aid at the end of July, bc Crow read it in NY Times. He forgot the pesky fact that both of the witnesses under oath in the House directly in touch w/Zelensky, Ambs Volker &amp; Taylor, confirmed Zelensky didn‚Äôt know until 8/29.
If Jason Crow wants to talk about how important it is to provide aid to Ukraine to fight Russia, surely he is about to point out that it was President Trump who provided lethal aid to Ukraine that President Obama refused to provide, right?
With their final words on the House floor, House Dems declared they proved their impeachment case ‚Äúbeyond a doubt‚Äù. 

Yesterday, they started the impeachment trial declaring they still needed a ton of facts in order to prove their case. 

Which is it? 

Can‚Äôt have it both ways!
Burisma is a corrupt Ukrainian gas co. run by a corrupt Ukrainian oligarch that hired Hunter Biden for at least 50k p/month w/no Ukraine or energy experience solely bc he was VP Biden‚Äôs son. Burisma/Biden shouldn‚Äôt be immune from scrutiny just bc Joe Biden is running for POTUS.
Ukrainians interfered in the 2016 election (see Chaly, Avakov, Chalupa‚Äôs work with the Ukrainian embassy, black ledger, origins of Steele Dossier. All 100% TRUE &amp; INDISPUTABLE).
The Dems just wasted an entire day in the Senate throwing a fit over missing all sorts of info they would still need to dig up in order to proceed. They are a day late &amp; MANY facts short of the air tight case they insisted they had when passing their sham impeachment articles.

Today was another disastrous day for the rule of law in NY. Illegal immigrants in the state can now get NYS driver‚Äôs licenses. The awful policies in Albany on so many fronts are a brutal warning shot for America of just how bad one part Dem rule would be in DC come 2021.
Schumer then insists that the issues related to Ukrainians interfering in the 2016 election and Burisma/Biden are just false conspiracy theories and that the President should have no ability whatsoever to demonstrate w/witnesses the FACTS, legitimacy, concern &amp; actual corruption.
Then Schumer insists we need to hear from 4 new witnesses to determine why there was a hold on $...even though the Dem impeachment case is built around their claim that it's known why there was a hold on aid &amp; that it was in return for investigations (which evidence refutes btw).
Schumer just repeated the same lie Pelosi, Schiff &amp; Nadler have stated over and over that the facts of this impeachment case are not in dispute. FALSE. This is alternate universe stuff that requires you to either be deaf, blind, ignorant, or infinitely partisan and closed minded.

That is all. 

Thank you for your attention.
History is going to be so MASSIVELY unkind towards Pelosi, Schiff and the rest of Congressional Democrats who continue supporting this impeachment charade.
https://t.co/wXgbsddedn
What the heck does "fake investigation into the elections" even mean? If Pelosi is referring to Ukrainians meddling in our '16 election that's a real issue (See Black Ledger, Chalupa, Origins of Steele Dossier, etc). Also, the Burisma/Zlovchevsky corruption issue is 100% real too
Ukraine didn't know there was a hold until Aug 29. The hold on aid was lifted shortly thereafter and guess what Ukraine had to do to get the hold lifted? NOTHING!!
Pelosi says, "The bribe is to grant or withhold military assistance in return for a public statement of a fake investigation into the elections." There is so much that is so wrong w/ this, but here's 2 basic points she's conveniently ignoring w/ her party's blind, enraged hate...
I don‚Äôt seem to recall House Dems campaigning last fall on a platform to tear our country in half on an absurd impeachment charade that‚Äôs DOA in the Senate. The halls of Congress have been a boulevard of broken dreams this year. Instead-&gt;Pass USMCA. Lower prescription drug costs.
The best first hand account has been from President Zelensky directly. He said he felt no pressure, no demand, no quid pro, nothing improper, etc. https://t.co/xEOQFWvCdH
Hunter Biden had no energy experience &amp; no Ukraine experience, but was hired for at least $50k p/month by a corrupt Ukraine gas company run by a corrupt Ukrainian oligarch SOLELY bc he was Joe Biden‚Äôs son. If that whole setup wasn‚Äôt illegal then it should be!
Dedicating this REO Speedwagon classic to the testimony of Ambassadors Taylor and Kent so far today: 
https://t.co/8DDEPIaYgM
Ambassador Taylor is telling Congress that Tim Morrison told him that Ambassador Sondland told Morrison that the President told Sondland...
An Ambassador can be recalled by the President at any time WITH or WITHOUT cause.
As Taylor testifies about the goal of requesting investigations into 2016 election interference and Burisma, keep in mind that Taylor admitted to me during his deposition that his ONLY basis of that information is that he read it in The NY Times. https://t.co/V5n2H6NaYd
Schiff isn‚Äôt even trying to hide it. He is the prosecutor, judge, jury, witness coach &amp; lead story teller of this kangaroo court. He‚Äôll burn the whole house down to take POTUS out. Charges don‚Äôt actually matter. Facts don‚Äôt actually matter. Evidence doesn‚Äôt actually matter.
Instead of eagerly trying so hard to tear our country in half with this disgusting impeachment circus, Dems should work WITH Republicans and the President to pass USMCA, lower the costs of prescription drugs, and more. Way too much hate poisoning their hearts &amp; minds these days!
Tomorrow‚Äôs Schiff Show features Ambs Taylor &amp; Kent, relying primarily on 2nd, 3rd, 4th &amp; ZERO hand info.

Dems have a new word of the day: ‚Äúextortion‚Äù. The shiny object of ‚Äúquid pro quo‚Äù totally fell apart on them. Same problem though w/their new shiny object: Ukraine didn‚Äôt know there was a hold on aid until just before it was lifted. They didn‚Äôt have to do anything to get it lifted

Maybe Obama provided sandwiches, socks &amp; pillows, but not Javelins. This wasn‚Äôt accurate what Vindman said. Obama didn‚Äôt provide lethal aid to Ukraine. Trump did though.

Kurt Volker was the deposition witness w/the most amt of 1st hand info of the recent US-Ukraine interactions being discussed.

Hunter Biden should put his corrupt Ukrainian gas/oligarch $ where his mouth is to testify &amp; answer GOP ?s. W/NO qualifications, he laid down w/Ukrainian dogs for $50k+ p month. Burisma/Zlovchevsky/Bidens shouldn‚Äôt be immune from scrutiny just bc VP Biden is running for POTUS!

Schiff desperately hopes Taylor shows quid pro quo linking US $ to the opening of an investigation.

The Dems/media are desperately relying on Taylor as their star witness to show there was an impeachable offense of quid pro quo.

This "evidence" would be thrown out of court so quickly for all of the right reasons. Here Taylor concedes to me that his ONLY substantive claim from his opening statement referencing Biden not only isn't first hand...it's not even second hand: https://t.co/akYOz8jBi3

It was not accurate for Taylor to say "but this was not to be" in his opening statement about the hold on aid getting released. It DID get released shortly thereafter as Taylor later acknowledges to me here: https://t.co/woE0yTeRi2
Star witness? Taylor said in depo he believed reason POTUS wanted Ukraine to investigate Ukrainians' interference w/ the 2016 election &amp; Burisma was just to get dirt on Biden. He later admitted to me his sole source of info was...wait for it...The NY Times. https://t.co/Yj6DUlkit7

Corruption in Ukraine is a top US policy priority as required by US law, but it‚Äôs been striking during the depos, how little focus/interest State Dept officials had to look into actual, specific corruption re Burisma/Zlovchevsky/Bidens &amp; interference by Ukrainians w ‚Äò16 election.

Fun facts Dems/media love omitting from their fairy tale 3rd, 4th, 5th &amp; NO hand stories:

1. Ukraine didn‚Äôt know there was a hold on aid until end of Aug. 

2. The hold on aid was released soon after that. 

3. Guess what Ukraine had to do to get the hold on aid lifted? NOTHING!
Fun fact from Yovanovitch transcript just released: No 1st hand info of quid pro quo linking new investigation in return for US aid although at end of depo in response to my ?s she tried citing Bill Taylor‚Äôs 2nd/3rd/4th hand info as her sole basis before she walked that back.
and when I asked her why the House Dem staffer was reaching out to her, Yovanovitch suggested maybe the outreach was just "to catch up". So a House Dem staffer she never spoke w/before in her life, helping to lead this impeachment, may have just been reaching out "to catch up"?
Interesting take. Another option for this CNN/Clinton hack to try out would be to read the entire transcript, including posting that ENTIRE several pg line of questioning where Amb Yovanovitch says that Aug 19 was the only time she has ever communicated w/ that House Dem staffer, https://t.co/qEX0Z09CuT
The transcripts from the interviews of Ambassadors Yovanovitch &amp; McKinley were just released. Will immediately review. Assuming all is accurate, having sat through both, there is NOTHING in there to impeach POTUS for. A Pres can recall an Amb at any time WITH or WITHOUT cause.
You can‚Äôt be all things to all people. Some people may want me as a Member of Congress to help rip our country in half with this impeachment charade. Absolutely not playing along with this bs effort by Adam Schiff and his cohorts to write the world‚Äôs greatest parody.

POTUS is right...This impeachment inquiry is "deranged". For those who triggered this impeachment charade, charges/evidence/facts don't actually matter.

President Clinton had the right to have counsel present to review docs provided to the committees, cross examine witnesses &amp; fully participate in committee hearings. It was also easier for the minority to subpoena witnesses &amp; docs.
In fact, all of these decisions are left to Schiff who ‚Äì under this partisan reso ‚Äì has the power to veto whatever he wants. He already has the authority to release the transcripts &amp; ensure due process, which he‚Äôs not doing. What makes us think he‚Äôs going to change going forward?
Perhaps it‚Äôs because this new resolution does not ensure:
Minority subpoena power;
Release of the transcripts;
Equal staffing between parties;
Counsel for the President and the ability for them to question witnesses and present evidence.
Also, the Clinton impeachment reso was written &amp; passed in a bipartisan manner. This is a stark contrast to yesterday‚Äôs ‚Äúimpeachment inquiry‚Äù reso dropped 24 hrs before being voted on &amp; the only bipartisan vote it received was AGAINST it.
It‚Äôs clear House Dems &amp; many of their media allies think Americans are idiots. The claim that yesterday‚Äôs impeachment inquiry reso is the same as what the House GOP provided during the Clinton impeachment is FALSE.

Doesn‚Äôt ensure minority subpoena power or release of transcripts. Doesn‚Äôt equally allocate staffing between parties. Doesn‚Äôt allow POTUS‚Äô counsel to be present to question witnesses &amp; present evidence. It‚Äôs just a Schiff Show.

Burisma, Joe Biden, Zlochevsky and Hunter Biden definitely shouldn‚Äôt get a free pass just bc Joe Biden is running for President. On top of Burisma and Zlochevsky‚Äôs other corruption, if the Biden family money scheme in Ukraine wasn‚Äôt illegal, then it should be.

Adam Schiff is trying to get the US drunk on his favorite cocktail:

There are three main ingredients: (1) Cherry-picking leaks, (2) withholding key facts, and (3) outright lying.

I discussed this AM on @ThisWeekABC w @jonkarl https://t.co/3A0OmgQapS
NO ONE in the Obama admin was more conflicted out to run point w/ Ukraine than Joe Biden. Maybe the US needs to change laws to make sure this never happens again in the future. If that Biden family scheme in Ukraine w/Burisma &amp; Zlochevsky wasn‚Äôt illegal, then it should‚Äôve been.
@ThisWeekABC @jonkarl With no relevant experience, Hunter got paid 50k+ p/month by corrupt foreigners, solely bc he was the VP's son. VP Biden threatened Ukraine w/the loss of $1B if the state prosecutor wasn‚Äôt immediately fired, who btw, had an open case into Burisma/Zlochevsky. Those are ALL facts!
I don't believe Burisma, Joe Biden, Zlochevsky, or Hunter Biden should be immune from scrutiny just bc Joe Biden is running for POTUS. Pres Trump &amp; many others (myself included!) have a huge problem w/the Biden's shady arrangement in Ukraine.
@ThisWeekABC @jonkarl https://t.co/NX9bRWZLx1
On process and on substance, this ‚Äúimpeachment inquiry‚Äù has been a train wreck circus enthusiastically tearing the country in half, bc of people who still haven‚Äôt accepted the will of the American voters in 2016. Have a score to settle? Do it at the ballot box! https://t.co/Wtq9snJSd8
Amb Yovanovitch‚Äôs opening statement amounts to ~1/150th of yesterday‚Äôs deposition. Once again, these don‚Äôt need to be in secret in Schiff‚Äôs bunker in the Capitol basement. Release the transcripts (Volker too!), stop cherry picking leaks, withholding key facts &amp; outright lying!
Participated all day in the depo of former Amb Yovanovitch. Not ONE word uttered over several hrs behind closed doors deep in the Capitol basement couldn't/shouldn't have been asked &amp; answered live in front of YOU. Time for Pelosi/Schiff to invite the public into their clown show
VP Biden was literally the last possible person in the Obama administration who should‚Äôve been running point with Ukraine. There was no other member of the Executive Branch more conflicted out than he was.

Why hasn't @RepAdamSchiff released the full transcript &amp; why aren't so many in the media demanding it? Because it's FULL of inconvenient facts! https://t.co/RFVqfaMOgD
Instead of working together to pass USMCA, lower prescription drug prices &amp; fight for the American people, House Dems continue to obsess over their partisan impeachment sideshow. We should be spending 100% of our time on the priorities most important to everyday Americans.
The American public is getting screwed by an enraged activist base trying to take down a sitting President.

Back in DC for Amb Sondland‚Äôs interview in AM as part of this partisan impeachment circus. Schiff‚Äôs still holding these in secret w min transparency &amp; cherry picked leaks. 4 days &amp; he STILL hasn‚Äôt released the Volker transcript. Why? Bc it‚Äôs filled w too many inconvenient facts!
The Kurds have fought, bled &amp; died fighting alongside the US. They have been warriors &amp; brothers in battle along the way. POTUS is right to want to end endless wars, but the Turks wiping out the Kurds will ABSOLUTELY NOT be an acceptable outcome after all of that.
The ONLY reason Hunter Biden was paid ridiculous sums of money by corrupt Burisma was that he was the VP‚Äôs son.

ZERO qualifications otherwise. No energy experience &amp; No Ukraine experience.

It left VP Biden w/MASSIVE conflict of interest.

This is either illegal or it should be.
Fascinating that much of the media has had zero interest in reporting on what was actually said by Amb Volker last Thursday in response to several hours of questioning by Dems &amp; GOP. It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt want to hear ANY truths that don‚Äôt support Schiff‚Äôs quid pro quo fairy tale. https://t.co/u3G4Kumpmm
It's been 3 days &amp; @RepAdamSchiff still hasn't released the transcript of Amb Volker's interview, instead just cherry picking some texts. I don't have to ask why, bc I was there w both of them Thurs. Schiff's not releasing it bc it obliterates his fairy tale quid pro charge.
USMCA ends NAFTA &amp; will add US jobs, increase GDP &amp; deliver new US investment. üëçüá∫üá∏üí™

@SpeakerPelosi, It‚Äôs time to vote. 

Let‚Äôs vote!!!
House Dems should IMMEDIATELY release Amb Volker‚Äôs several hour long transcribed interview so ALL can read it. He candidly &amp; professionally OBLITERATED the bogus charge POTUS made a quid pro quo offer to Zelensky connecting aid to Ukraine with an investigation into Bidens. https://t.co/8zFSIoRHjX
.@RepAdamSchiff

1) Claims he &amp; his team weren‚Äôt in contact w whistleblower. Fact Check: ‚ùå

2) Said POTUS asked Zelensky to ‚Äúmanufacture dirt‚Äù on Bidens. Fact Check: ‚ùå

3) Reading to Congress of call transcript. Fact Check: ‚ùå

(still waiting for that Russia collusion evidence)
This impeachment process is a partisan clown show. The Dems are eagerly ripping our country in 1/2 for political expediency.

Meanwhile, despite precedent, NO VOTE, no minority subpoena power, POTUS‚Äô counsel not allowed at hearings to present evidence &amp; question witnesses, etc.
It's been 24 hrs &amp; the Volker transcript still hasn't been released by House Dems. No good reason why this hasn't been done yet. Anything to keep the Schiff quid pro quo fairy tale alive one more night. These tactics are unfair to the American public &amp; dividing our great country. https://t.co/xNTfJeEBUc
*wasnt until*
6) The hold was lifted &amp; aid released. 
According to Amb Volker's in depth testimony, at no point in time, from the initial hold to the release of the aid, was there any quid pro quo or other linkage between US aid &amp; Ukraine investigating the Bidens.
4) Amb Volker was in direct contact w Pres Zelensky &amp; his team in the weeks to follow &amp; they didn't mention anything to him about a hold on aid. It was until after the @politico story that they brought it up.
5) The aid was getting released regardless of any corruption inv.
2) In the readouts Amb Volker received of the call from not only the US gov't, but also the Ukraine gov't, there was no mention of aid being on hold or a quid pro quo.
3) When Amb Volker met w/Pres Zelensky on 7/26, there was no mention of aid on hold or a quid pro quo.
Amb Volker was VERY clear yesterday in his testimony that it is UNTRUE Pres Trump demanded a quid pro quo of Pres Zelensky that US aid was contingent upon an investigation by Ukraine into the Bidens:
1) Pres Zelensky had no knowledge aid was on hold at the time of the call.
Amb Volker just put a dagger in the heart of Schiff‚Äôs fairy tale claims of quid pro quo. While House Democrats may prefer cherry picking the Ambassador‚Äôs texts without the other 99% of the story, they should release the entire transcript of yesterday‚Äôs marathon interview ASAP!
Instead of House Dems releasing Ambassador Volker's texts drip by drip, just release all of his texts in Congress' possession right now as well as today's transcribed interview. Just give the media &amp; public EVERYTHING so Americans can form their own independent conclusions.

Are you supposed to then go on national TV &amp; say ‚ÄúWe have not spoken directly with the whistle blower. We would like to.‚Äù

Are you supposed to then inject fictional words into @POTUS‚Äô mouth that weren‚Äôt actually in the transcript?

You refuse to shoot straight. It‚Äôs a disgrace. https://t.co/0frlQ32Lmc
What did Schiff do next? He had an impeachment inquiry launched to take down @POTUS just before Members of Congress &amp; the public could actually read the transcript first or the whistleblower‚Äôs complaint. Schiff delivered HIS version of the call, which has been loaded w fiction https://t.co/jWTdElRHG2
‚ÄúWe have not spoken to the whistleblower. We would like to.‚Äù @RepAdamSchiff told the American public when asked on MSNBC if he had been in contact with the whistleblower. Another lie. https://t.co/jWTdElRHG2
Shocker (not really)...@RepAdamSchiff knew the whistleblower‚Äôs allegations before the whistleblower‚Äôs atty &amp; before there was a whistleblower complaint.
