It is abhorrent that we continue to see apparent broad daylight corruption, Hochul donor after Hochul donor, Hochul connection after Hochul connection without any action. Corruption might benefit the Hochul campaign, but it comes at a steep cost to taxpayers who ultimately pay the price for this brand of crime. It’s shameful that Albany continues to be the Capital of Corruption,”  “Time and time again, Comptroller DiNapoli is complicit in corruption through his silence. This latest case was a contract put out to bid that his office must stop. Other cases have no-bids because of never-ending emergency powers and New Yorkers deserve a comptroller who will raise his voice and demand a thorough accounting and who will put an end to a practice that breeds corruption. I demand that Letitia James investigate this matter,” Scandals stemming from Hochul’s less than year old administration include: Hochul’s husband, William Hochul, serves as general counsel to Delaware North, a multi-billion dollar food and hospitality company that operates concessions, dining and private boxes at the stadium. The deal hatched in secret violates her own “recusal memorandum” filed with JCOPE and further appears to breach §74 of the Public Officers Law.  The Attorney General can launch an investigation into the numerous scandals with a referral from the Executive.  ### PAID FOR BY HENRY FOR NEW YORK  | © 2022 All Rights ReservedFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE August 2, 2022 AG CANDIDATE MICHAEL HENRY & COMPTROLLER CANDIDATE PAUL RODRIGUEZ DEMAND INVESTIGATION of ‘PAY-TO-PLAY’ CORRUPTION Albany, NY — Attorney General candidate Michael Henry  Comptroller candidate Paul Rodriguez said Michael Henry.  said Paul Rodriguez.

He also requested that JCOPE look into any potential violations by Hochul’s top aide. Hochul’s husband, William Hochul, serves as general counsel to Delaware North, a multi-billion dollar food and hospitality company that operates concessions, dining and private boxes at the stadium. The deal hatched in secret violates her own “recusal memorandum” filed with JCOPE and further appears to breach §74 of the Public Officers Law.  “When we say, ‘Go Bills,’ we don’t mean ‘Go  Bills to Hochul’s husband,”  “Under One Party Control, we no longer have an Attorney General willing to call out the apparent broad daylight corruption occurring on her ticket. Today, I am requesting that JCOPE open a full investigation into the violations of the Public Officers Law in relation to the secret Buffalo Bills deal,”  Three days before the April 1 budget deadline, Governor Hochul announced a $1.4 Billion deal to construct a new Bills stadium in Orchard Park.

JCOPE must look into this matter as well. “We need to get to the bottom of how this opaque $850 million deal was made because New Yorkers are sick and tired of a corrupt Albany. Government needs to work for the people and it’s not meant to line the pockets of the favored few,”  “Lawmakers should not greenlight corruption in this budget either. They must wait for a full investigation to take place,”  A copy of the JCOPE investigation request is attached. ### PAID FOR BY HENRY FOR NEW YORK  | © 2022 All Rights ReservedFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 4, 2022 JCOPE MUST INVESTIGATE HOCHUL’S BUFFALO BILLS DEAL: ATTORNEY GENERAL CANDIDATE MICHAEL HENRY New York, NY — Attorney General candidate Michael Henry said Henry.
