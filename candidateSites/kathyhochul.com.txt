						P.O. Box 1463					 New York NY, 10021Kathy Hochul is the 57th Governor of New York. keeping our communities safe, bringing down the cost of living for New Yorkers, and investing in schools to get our kids back on track.Meet Antonio Delgado - Kathy Hochul facebook twitter instagram youtube facebook twitter instagram youtube facebook twitter instagram youtubeAntonio DelgadoBorn and raised in Schenectady, Antonio is a native New Yorker. His parents worked hard for General Electric, benefited from a thriving economy, and were able to pursue the American Dream of building a better future for Antonio and his younger brother. Antonio attended Colgate University, in Hamilton, New York, where he graduated with high honors and earned a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford. From there, he went to law school at Harvard, which is where he met his wife Lacey, a native of Ulster County. In 2018, Antonio decided to run for Congress because for too long, leaders in Washington failed to give voice to working people struggling to achieve the American Dream. For too long they failed to provide a vision forward in an ever-changing global economy that left thousands of New Yorkers behind. The past few decades have seen good-paying jobs like those Antonio’s parents had disappear, with fewer opportunities for families seeking their share of the American Dream. “Growing up the rules were simple: work hard, do your homework and go to church. The values my parents instilled in me growing up here are the same values that inspired me to run for Congress” In Congress, Antonio was recognized as one of the most active new members of Congress for his efforts to pass legislation through the House and Senate, and keep constituents informed of his work. Since taking office in 2019, Antonio has maintained his commitment to effective and bipartisan lawmaking that delivers real results and has had 18 bills signed into law. In 2021, he was named the fourth most bipartisan member in all of Congress and first among Democrats by the Common Ground Committee, and was honored twice with the Jefferson-Hamilton Award for Bipartisanship from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Antonio has been a fierce advocate for New York, helping us recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, protecting our small businesses and supporting family farms. The latest federal rescue plan included Antonio’s Direct Support for Communities Act which delivers $130.2 billion in aid directly to local communities, including $10.8 billion to counties, towns, and villages in New York. Antonio also introduced the Rebuild Rural America Act, aiming to build on this first of its kind direct federal investment in rural areas by creating non-competitive flexible multi-year grants available exclusively to rural communities. Antonio and Lacey are raising their young twin sons in Rhinebeck.Meet New York Lieutenant Governor

Too many New Yorkers face homelessness and struggle to find safe, affordable housing options. This crisis has been further exacerbated by the pandemic, particularly in our Black and Brown communities. As Governor, Kathy is taking bold action to address the homelessness crisis, including establishing teams of trained mental health practitioners, known as Safe Options Support (SOS) teams, to work with emergency shelters, outreach providers and permanent supportive housing providers to help transition New Yorkers living on the street into stable housing. Governor Hochul has also enacted significant measures to expand access to affordable housing, prevent evictions, provide relief to landlords, and keep families in their homes. As part of her agenda for New York’s comeback, she launched a comprehensive 5-year housing plan to invest $25 billion to create and preserve 100,000 affordable housing units, including 10,000 units with supportive services for vulnerable New Yorkers. By investing in efforts to keep more New Yorkers in their homes and address the homelessness crisis, Governor Hochul is standing true to her commitment to address these issues head-on and support the economic security of New Yorkers.Join Our Team

						P.O. Box 1463					 New York NY, 10021About - Kathy Hochul facebook twitter instagram youtube facebook twitter instagram youtube facebook twitter instagram youtubeKathy HochulAbout KathySince taking office, she has brought a fresh and collaborative approach to governing and is working hard to get results for New Yorkers. As Governor, Kathy has taken decisive action to deliver immediate relief to working and middle class families and small businesses, beat back the pandemic, and accelerate New York’s economic recovery. In addition, she has reaffirmed New York’s position as a national leader in defending reproductive rights and in combating climate change. Governor Hochul has also introduced a bold agenda to promote greater equity and expand opportunity for every New Yorker — from making New York more affordable to helping small businesses keep their doors open, strengthening public safety, and leading the fight for justice, dignity, and equality for all. A lifelong New Yorker, Kathy was born and raised in a blue-collar Irish Catholic family in Buffalo that instilled in her a deep passion for public service. Kathy watched her mother raise six children. And she watched her dad dream big for his family — working in a steel plant by day and getting an education by night. She took those lessons of courage, risk-taking, and her own fighting spirit to become a student organizer and activist at Syracuse University, and then a young attorney and a legislative assistant to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. She continued to pursue public service by serving her local community on the Hamburg Town Board before becoming Erie County Clerk. In 2011, Kathy was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a proud Democrat in Western New York. In Congress, she was a pivotal vote against efforts to defund Medicare and repeal the Affordable Care Act. Kathy was elected to statewide office in 2014, and again in 2018, becoming the Lieutenant Governor of New York State. As Lieutenant Governor, she put in the work to represent all New Yorkers — visiting all 62 counties every year and ensuring that every community had a seat at the table. While she is making history as New York’s first female Governor, Kathy came to Albany to make a difference. She is dedicated to fighting for every single New Yorker and ensuring our State comes back from this pandemic stronger than ever before.Meet New York Governor

Today, her leadership is more important than ever, as states across the country — along with Donald Trump’s Supreme Court — continue pushing anti-abortion laws that will put tens of millions of people at risk. As Governor, Kathy’s work has affirmed reproductive rights and cemented New York as a safe haven for all people seeking care. As part of these efforts, she has directed state agencies to coordinate a statewide public information campaign, including developing a Patient Bill of Rights to make New Yorkers aware of their rights and legal protections. Additionally, she directed the state to update existing regulations to make medication abortions more accessible during telehealth visits and urged Facebook to provide information on and take action to combat abortion misinformation online. As she has throughout her career, Governor Hochul will continue fighting for reproductive rights and will work to ensure, without a doubt, that those seeking care in New York will be protected.Join Our Team

Working with partners at all levels, she has enacted legislation to further strengthen New York’s nation-leading gun laws and provide public safety officials with the tools to crack down on the distribution and possession of dangerous weapons. Governor Hochul has also increased the state’s collaboration with communities facing increased gun violence, directing tens of millions of dollars in grants to community and hospital-based violence intervention programs that work to reduce firearm-related incidents through mediation, mentoring, and community engagement. Governor Hochul also understands that our communities are stronger and safer when every member has the opportunity to contribute and is committed to creating pathways to reduce recidivism. For far too long, formerly incarcerated New Yorkers have been forced to deal with the lifelong consequences of criminal convictions that deny them a second chance to reclaim their role as an equal member of society. That’s why her agenda for New York’s comeback includes a new “Jail-to-Jobs” initiative to ensure incarcerated people have the support they need to find employment during re-entry, as well as the restoration of the Tuition Assistance program for incarcerated people — ending a 30-year ban.Join Our Team

Under her administration, Governor Hochul is rejecting the toxic politics of the past and is resetting the tone in Albany.Get involved with the campaignFrom day one, Kathy has been committed to restoring New Yorkers’ trust in government by improving transparency and increasing accountability.

Governor Hochul has also introduced sweeping transparency initiatives across state government — including steps to expedite public records requests, require state agencies to review their compliance with existing transparency laws, and root out harassment and discrimination by mandating ethics training.Join Our Team

As part of her agenda for New York’s comeback, Governor Hochul announced a bold plan to move forward with a major new rail service that will connect Brooklyn and Queens, the Interborough Express. She is also focused on reconnecting neighborhoods across New York that were severed by asphalt highways, disproportionately impacting communities of color. As Governor, Kathy is also leading the largest ever investment in New York’s digital infrastructure, putting $1 billion toward connecting more New Yorkers with high-speed internet to boost innovation and economic growth for all communities. Governor Hochul understands the urgency of the state’s infrastructure needs, and with the landmark infrastructure bill passing in 2021, she will continue to make investments in more resilient transportation systems to improve the lives of New Yorkers, bolster the state’s economy, and address the impacts of climate change.Join Our Team

In Congress, she proudly fought to save Medicare funding and the Affordable Care Act, putting politics aside to vote against its repeal. Over a decade later, too many families still struggle with the unpredictable costs of prescription drugs and inequities in coverage persist. In the midst of a global pandemic, access to quality, affordable health care is more important than ever.  Governor Hochul took the reins during the worst crisis of our lifetimes and has shown steady and effective leadership throughout. She has taken decisive action to combat the spread of COVID-19, by expanding vaccination efforts — including an effective vaccine mandate for health care workers, increasing testing capacity, and keeping our economy open and kids in school.  She has also committed to a $10 billion investment to grow New York’s health care workforce by 20% over the next five years — the largest investment in health care in state history. This includes more than $4 billion to support wages and bonuses for health care workers. As the state continues to beat back the pandemic, New Yorkers can trust that Governor Hochul will put politics aside, as she always has, and prioritize their health and safety.Join Our Team

                  Friends for Kathy Hochul← or Cart 0 ×FAQFAQWhat's the status of my order? What does “Awaiting Fulfillment” even mean?
         
          My order still hasn't shipped! Why is it taking so long to get my gear?
         
          I made a mistake with my order. Can I change the items or the shipping info?
         
          The webstore is broken! I can't complete my order! Help!
         
          I received my order, but my stuff is missing/damaged/wrong!
         
          Can I order gear that's no longer available in the webstore?
         
        How do I contact the campaign?
         
          If the above didn’t answer your question, please

            Webstore orders generally ship within seven business days. 

             

            At present, the webstore is not capable of shipping orders outside of the United States. 

             

            You may return items that are in 'like new' condition within 14 days of delivery for a full refund. 

            In cases where the return is a result of our error (you received an incorrect or defective item) we'll also pay the full return shipping costs. 

            You should expect to receive your refund within four weeks of giving your package to the return shipper, however, in many cases you will receive a refund more quickly. This time period includes the transit time for us to receive your return from the shipper (5 to 10 business days), the time it takes us to process your return once we receive it (3 to 5 business days), and the time it takes your bank to process our refund request (5 to 10 business days). 

            If you need to return an item, please
             
            with your order number and details about the product you would like to return. We will respond as quickly as possible with instructions for how to return items from your order.

						P.O. Box 1463					 New York NY, 10021ICYMI: Syracuse Post-Standard Editorial Board Endorses Governor Hochul - Kathy Hochul facebook twitter instagram youtube facebook twitter instagram youtube facebook twitter instagram youtubeICYMI: Syracuse Post-Standard Editorial Board Endorses Governor HochulThe Syracuse Post-Standard editorial board today   Governor Hochul for a full term. The editorial board praised Governor Hochul’s effective leadership in responding to crises including the Tops mass shooting and Supreme Court rulings on concealed carry and abortion. They also highlighted the governor’s success in bringing the Micron Technology semiconductor factory to Central New York and slammed Lee Zeldin for his “often fact-free” messaging and his “troubling… unsubstantiated claims of election fraud.” The endorsement joins a number of other endorsements from editorial boards across the state, including  ,  ,  , the  , and  . 
 The editorial board endorses Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat from Western New York, for a full, four-year term in the job thrust upon her by the resignation of her predecessor.  Hochul appointed new, respected leadership at the Department of Health, whose credibility had been damaged by the previous administration’s attempt to minimize the toll of Covid-19 in nursing homes. The new governor kept schools open when the omicron variant swept the state in winter; responded to the Buffalo mass shooting with compassion and legislative action on guns; countered Supreme Court rulings gutting abortion rights and the state’s concealed-carry law; and revamped JCOPE, the toothless ethics watchdog. That included a last-minute legislative push for a Green CHIPS bill providing up to $10 billion in state aid to chipmakers. Hochul says every dollar of taxpayer money will have a return on investment of $20.  Hochul’s opponent is Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin, of Long Island. Zeldin’s relentless — and often fact-free — messaging on crime has drowned out his credible ideas about how to improve New York’s business climate, rein in spending and budget responsibly.   Such an order would be temporary; then he’d have to persuade Democrats who control the Legislature to rewrite the law they created. Zeldin condemned the violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 and says he never once called Joe Biden’s election illegitimate. Yet he still flogs claims of voting irregularities in Pennsylvania and Arizona that courts rejected. […] Hochul says the problem is not bail reform;  . Courts ground to a complete halt during the pandemic and still have not recovered from the backlog.   […] . […] Hochul’s first state budget was the largest ever — over $220 billion — including record school aid and $1.6 billion in an unrestricted lump sum doled out at the governor’s discretion for the Bills stadium and other pet projects. […] Hochul, a native of Buffalo, found her political voice at Syracuse University in the late 1970s. She served in local government and in Congress. For five years, she crisscrossed the state as Cuomo’s lieutenant governor, shaking hands, seeing problems and listening to the concerns of real people.###

						P.O. Box 1463					 New York NY, 10021NEW YORK –  Syracuse.com:  Hochul deserves a shot at putting her stamp on the office and achieving her goals of a more transparent, effective and ethical state government. After months of tumult in Albany, Hochul stepped into the executive role in August 2021 with vigor, candor and calm. She is the first woman to be governor. Hochul’s biggest achievement for Central New York was landing the Micron Technology semiconductor factory with months of personal lobbying and a suite of state incentives.  “I’ll take that deal any day,” she told the editorial board, pointing to the benefits of providing good-paying job opportunities to the region’s young people, people of color and women. Zeldin claims he can’t change abortion law, but promises to suspend criminal justice reforms enacted by the Legislature unilaterally, on Day One. It’s an empty promise. More troubling is Zeldin’s unsubstantiated claims of election fraud that led him to vote against certifying the Electoral College vote on Jan. 6, 2021. It is disqualifying, in our view.  the entire criminal justice system isn’t working She would appoint a new chief judge to get the courts moving, provide support for police and violence disrupters, and get more guns off the streets. Zeldin’s solution would be to turn back the clock to 2016, when the jails were full of poor, brown and young people awaiting trial on minor charges Hochul is the first governor from Upstate in 100 years — and it’s about time. We endorse Hochul for a full term to forge a new path as governor guided by facts, not fearmongering.“We endorse Hochul for a full term to forge a new path as governor guided by facts, not fearmongering.” Highlights from the story below.  By Advance Media NY Editorial Board, 11/1/22ICYMI: Buffalo News Editorial Board Endorses Governor Kathy Hochul - Kathy Hochul facebook twitter instagram youtube facebook twitter instagram youtube facebook twitter instagram youtubeICYMI: Buffalo News Editorial Board Endorses Governor Kathy Hochul###

					© Copyright 2022 | Made byPress Release Published: October 29, 2022 “ Gov. Kathy Hochul has compiled an impressive record of achievement in the 14 months she has served as New York’s 57th governor .”  Yesterday, the Buffalo News editorial board announced its endorsement of Governor Kathy Hochul, citing her impressive state budget, powerful response to the Buffalo mass shooting, and strong focus on combating crime. The editorial board said the weaknesses of her opponent, Lee Zeldin, only underscore the fact that Governor Hochul is the clear choice this November.  The editorial praised Governor Hochul’s leadership, describing her as “​​ simultaneously even-keeled and tough as nails.” Over the last 14 months, Governor Hochul has proven she has what it takes to lead New York forward.  The Buffalo News endorsement comes on the heels of other editorial board endorsements from across the state, including  Amsterdam News ,  Newsday , the  New York Times , and  Times Union .  Highlights from the story below.  by The Editorial Board, 10/28/22 : a far-seeing state budget; a powerful response to a massacre in Buffalo; a fair deal to keep the Bills in Buffalo; and, yes, a focus on dealing with crime. On her own merits, the Democrat has earned a full term in the governor’s office. The weaknesses of her Republican opponent only underscore the fact. […] 
 
 Republican states – and Republican candidates, including Zeldin – howl about crime, but they’re content to let just about anyone have any kind of firearm and take it wherever they want. […] There’s more to Hochul’s record, including her significant role in luring microchip manufacturer Micron to a Syracuse suburb.  […]  Zeldin has shown himself to be reckless. He is among the   who, only hours after a violent insurrection,  . In doing so, he and other Republicans did the bidding of the rioters who laid siege to the Capitol that day. Some police officers died.  His opposition to abortion may be, for now, a non-issue, but it’s a significant deviation from what New Yorkers support. * *
