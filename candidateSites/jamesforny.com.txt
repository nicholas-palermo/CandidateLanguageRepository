With the use of common tools, though, they can be used to hold together the other parts of a ghost gun. State laws that took effect earlier this year criminalized the sale and possession of ghost guns. The attorney general’s effort to clamp down on ghost guns comes less than three weeks after a gunman killed 10 people with a semiautomatic rifle in a Buffalo grocery store in a racially motivated assault. The defendant, Payton Gendron, wrote in a document he published online shortly before the slayings that he had purchased the weapon legally at a gun shop, but modified it with his father’s drill to circumvent the state law limiting the ammunition capacity of such a rifle.               © 2022 James for NY.

Wade.  Opponents of abortion, meanwhile, acknowledge that changing the law in New York remains a challenge, but one they will work to embrace.  The decision by the court has led to a patchwork of evolving abortion policies at the state level. Some states have already moved to ban abortion in many circumstances outright while it will remain legal elsewhere, including in New York.  James, who recently said she had had an abortion years ago, said in a joint statement with state attorneys general she remained committed to "supporting and expanding access to abortion care nationwide." “While this is a perilous moment for our nation, it is a moment that calls for action," the joint statement said. "Our promise to our residents is simple: We’ll never stop defending your rights. Regardless of the decision in Dobbs, broad access to abortion remains protected in states that recognize reproductive freedom, such as ours. We refuse to go back to the days of politicians trying to tell people what to do with their bodies. When it comes to abortion care, it’s your body and your right to choose. Nobody else gets to make those decisions."               © 2022 James for NY. All rights reserved.Meet Letitia

In 2013, she was elected Public Advocate for the City of New York. Her office handled over 32,000 constituent complaints and passed more legislation than all previous Public Advocates combined, including a groundbreaking law that banned questions about salary history from the hiring process, to help close the gender pay gap. As Public Advocate, she stood up for our most vulnerable communities and served as a watchdog over New York City government agencies. Her leadership transformed the Public Advocate’s office into a formidable engine of change. Now, as Attorney General and head of the state’s Department of Law, Letitia is both the ‘People’s Lawyer’ and the state’s chief legal officer, serving as the guardian of the legal rights of the citizens of New York, its organizations, and its natural resources. Every day, Letitia fights and delivers for the people of New York. Her office has mounted key cases against the gun lobby, Big Tech, and big pharmaceutical companies, winning over a billion dollars in opioid settlements to invest in communities statewide. She sued the Trump administration more than 75 times, protecting workers, immigrants, health care, voting, the environment, and the Constitution. Her office has taken down hundreds of drug and gun traffickers, and removed thousands of deadly weapons from our streets. She has gone after bad landlords, predatory lenders, and financial scammers, who prey on the vulnerable and try to cheat our neighbors. She has fought for better conditions at nursing homes, protecting our elderly loved ones. And she has stood up for New Yorkers throughout the pandemic, cracking down on price gouging, fighting for safe workplaces, and helping families to stop evictions.

Attorney General Accuses Trump of ‘Staggering’ Fraud in Lawsuit — Letitia JamesNY Times: N.Y. Attorney General Accuses Trump of ‘Staggering’ Fraud in LawsuitCNY: NY AG sues gun distributors for fueling gun crisis NY1: AG James Calls for Child Care Expansion in New YorkAttorney General Letitia James of New York filed a sweeping lawsuit on Wednesday that accused Donald J. Trump, his family business and three of his children of lying to lenders and insurers by fraudulently overvaluing his assets by billions of dollars. Ms. James is seeking to bar the Trumps, including Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, from ever running a business in the state again. She concluded that Mr. Trump and his business violated state criminal laws and “plausibly” broke federal laws as well. Her office, which lacks authority to file criminal charges in this case, referred the findings to federal prosecutors in Manhattan. They declined to comment on whether they would investigate. The 220-page lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, lays out in new and startling detail how Mr. Trump’s annual financial statements were a compendium of lies, according to Ms. James. The statements — yearly records that include the company’s estimated value of its holdings and debts — wildly inflated the worth of nearly every one of its marquee properties, according to the lawsuit. They include Mar-a-Lago in Florida, Trump Tower and 40 Wall Street in Manhattan.               © 2022 James for NY. All rights reserved.Meet Letitia

James   to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) urging them to probe the “frequent and lengthy outages” throughout Puerto Rico since Luma Energy took over operations of the electric grid in 2021.  “While I fully support relief efforts underway to help Puerto Rico, I am convinced that we need long-term structural support for the island, not just band aids that take us from one crisis to the next,” James  . “One of these structural challenges is the power grid and the electrical supply Puerto Ricans rely on for basic necessities.”               © 2022 James for NY.

Attorney General Accuses Trump of ‘Staggering’ Fraud in Lawsuit CBS NEWS: New York Attorney General Letitia James wants National Weather Service to issue severe weather alerts in more languages-- New York should expand child care programs amid a "crisis" of caregiving facing families, state Attorney General Letitia James said Sunday at a campaign rally centered around the issue. James is highlighting the child care issue as state lawmakers in the coming days could approve a budget that increases spending for child care programs and expands access to more middle-income families in New York to subsidized care.  “The child care crisis predates the pandemic and now we have the opportunity to make real investments in affordable, high-quality child care and early education for the entire state,” she said. “I have fought for child care my entire career and I will continue to champion the expansion of child care and the workers who educate and care for our young children.”               © 2022 James for NY.

Andrew Cuomo claimed victory in his bid for a third term. On Thursday, it was his endorsed candidate for attorney general, Letitia James, issuing him a stinging rebuke.  "It is now clear the former governor will not accept any version of these events other than his own," James told New York Democrats at the party's convention on Thursday. "To achieve that, he is now claiming the mantle of victim and disgracefully attacking anyone in his path."               © 2022 James for NY. All rights reserved.Meet Letitia

Now seeking a second term as "the people's lawyer," she clearly deserves another term. Under Ms. James' leadership, the Department of Law has taken on a host of high-profile cases, including a pending civil action against former President Donald Trump and his family organization for what the state says was a pattern of fraud in undervaluing properties for tax purposes and overvaluing them to obtain favorable rates on loans. She took on the National Rifle Association, too — it's incorporated in New York — and though a court has dismissed her attempt to dissolve the organization, the allegations of self-dealing and abuse of donors' funds remain to be litigated. Her office joined with other states and localities to sue opioid manufacturers and distributors for causing a national epidemic that left millions of Americans addicted and more than 932,000 dead since 1999. Settlements so far have brought the state $1.6 billion, with more cases pending, money that will go to treatment and other efforts to abate the health crisis.               © 2022 James for NY.

Letitia James has taken the expansive view, tackling issues like abortion access, child poverty and nursing home quality alongside the office’s traditional remit of corruption, guns, drugs and white-collar crime. James’s heart is in the right place. She has earned a second term as attorney general.               © 2022 James for NY. All rights reserved.Meet Letitia

She’s investigating Donald Trump. Can she beat the two meanest men in politics? — Letitia JamesNew York Magazine: Letitia James has angered Andrew Cuomo. She’s investigating Donald Trump. Can she beat the two meanest men in politics?New York Times: Letitia James Doesn’t Need to Run for Governor to Grab the Spotlight, New York State attorney general   was on a boat, fishing, with  . The then-governor had asked her to take a tourism-boosting trip to Lake Ontario. It was almost a year into her first term, which she had won in part thanks to his decision to throw his political weight behind her 2018 primary bid. It wasn’t well known at the time, but Cuomo and James had recently experienced a bumpy patch. In June, James had overridden Cuomo’s wishes by issuing a statement supporting the Green Light bill, which granted undocumented New York residents the ability to legally apply for driver’s licenses. Cuomo publicly favored the measure but, according to James and members of her staff, privately wanted her office to rule it unconstitutional. At Lake Ontario, six weeks after their clash over Green Light, Cuomo had insisted that they fish alone, with only a captain and first mate aboard. No staffers would join them on the boat, and photographers would capture images from a separate vessel. One of James’s aides recalled how she and her colleagues had watched their boss head out onto the water, joking nervously about whether they’d ever see her again.               © 2022 James for NY.

             $6.00 × Facebook Twitter InstagramFAQFAQWhat's the status of my order? What does “Awaiting Fulfillment” even mean?
         
          My order still hasn't shipped! Why is it taking so long to get my gear?
         
          I made a mistake with my order. Can I change the items or the shipping info?
         
          The webstore is broken! I can't complete my order! Help!
         
          I received my order, but my stuff is missing/damaged/wrong!
         
          Can I order gear that's no longer available in the webstore?
         
        How do I contact the campaign?
         
          If the above didn’t answer your question, please

            Webstore orders generally ship within seven business days. 

             

            At present, the webstore is not capable of shipping orders outside of the United States. 

             

            You may return items that are in 'like new' condition within 14 days of delivery for a full refund. 

            In cases where the return is a result of our error (you received an incorrect or defective item) we'll also pay the full return shipping costs. 

            You should expect to receive your refund within four weeks of giving your package to the return shipper, however, in many cases you will receive a refund more quickly. This time period includes the transit time for us to receive your return from the shipper (5 to 10 business days), the time it takes us to process your return once we receive it (3 to 5 business days), and the time it takes your bank to process our refund request (5 to 10 business days). 

            If you need to return an item, please
             
            with your order number and details about the product you would like to return. We will respond as quickly as possible with instructions for how to return items from your order.
