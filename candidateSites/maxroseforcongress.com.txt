   Special interests and giant corporations have used the tax code to rig the system and enrich themselves, even as wages and benefits for the average American worker have stagnated. Fifty five of Americans’ largest and most profitable companies paid   in federal taxes in 2020. No corporation should be able to exploit loopholes and rely on an army of lobbyists to avoid doing their part. 
 Max will work hard to ensure that the wealthiest amongst us don’t pay a lower tax rate than teachers, cops, firemen, and restaurant workers. Max took action and helped lead the charge to abolish the carried interest loophole, which allows specific entities and individuals to claim their compensation for services as investment gains, allowing them to pay lower tax rates than middle class workers. At the same time, we also need to create a tax system that gives hard working Americans a tax cut, not corporations and the wealthiest amongst us like the Trump Tax Scam did. To achieve this tax fairness vision, Max supports raising both the long-term capital gains tax rate for the ultra wealthy so they no longer pay a lower tax rate than middle class workers as well as the floor of the alternative minimum tax, which has unfairly excluded middle class families. Max supports closing egregious corporate tax loopholes and creating a minimum corporate tax rate, while at the same time ensuring that America’s overall corporate tax rate remains competitive. At the same time, Max supports meaningfully expanding the earned income tax, child tax credits, and restoring the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction, ensuring that middle class New Yorkers are no longer saddled with this unfair and targeted tax increase. Max also supports closing the stepped-up basis loophole, an unfair tax policy that allows for assets to pass from one generation to the next with significant tax benefits. Lastly, Max believes that NYC and New York State must maintain its tax code competitiveness with other states in order to attract business and entrepreneurs. 
 In short, our tax code and regulatory system cannot set back innovation and the rate of business or job creation, but it also should not exist to disproportionately benefit the wealthiest amongst us and the largest of corporations. The tax code must be on the side of the working and middle class. While in office, Max was a leader in pushing the bipartisan  , which would make substantial strides towards fully restoring the SALT deduction for all hard-working Americans, including thousands of public safety workers. 
 
 
 As a congressional district with one of the highest rates of unionization in the country, NY-11 deserves a Member of Congress who won’t undermine workers’ rights and attack their right to organize. Max stands as a nationally-recognized supporter of organized labor and will continue to fight for organized labor to be the bedrock of a strong middle-class. 
 Max helped lead the effort to pass the bipartisan   through the House which would expand labor unions’ negotiating power, provide new protections for unions and workers, and stiffen penalties for companies who abuse workers’ rights. Max opposes those in both parties who’ve sold out the working class by undermining unions in the name of shareholder dividends and stock buybacks, and has worked to ensure workers receive higher wages, reasonable hours and better benefits including quality healthcare coverage and paid sick leave. American workers built this economy and it’s time they get their rightful share in the prosperity that they created. As Congressman, Max will work to finally pass the   into law and finally restore unions as a fundamental driver of the American middle class. 
 Max also believes that those who’ve worked throughout their lives deserve to retire with dignity. He supports the  , which will expand and protect Social Security into the next century against insolvency and ensure no American is forced to age in poverty. Max will also fight Republican attempts to raise the retirement age and cut Social Security benefits, just as he delivered for hundreds of Staten Islanders and South Brooklynites who were unfairly denied the Social Security disability benefits they deserved. 
 Max is also a supporter of the fight for 15 and was a cosponsor of the raise the wage act while in Congress that would have raised the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15.00. 
 
 
 Max supports the government's recent action calling on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether companies are using illegal methods to keep gas prices high and punish them accordingly. He also supports using all the tools at our disposal to increase OPEC’s oil production and to tap into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve so as to reverse the increase in gasoline prices. While it is evermore urgent that America transition away from a gasoline-based transportation system, hard working New Yorkers should not be subjected to egregious shorterm price hikes as this transition is carried out. And Max will fight for both administrative action and legislation to fix our supply chain issues which are also driving inflation, while working to combat COVID-19 and address childcare issues so that workers who want to, can return to the workforce and labor supply can meet demand.Menu

   Max strongly opposes efforts by states around the country that instituted draconian abortion laws that clearly infringe on a women’s right to choose, putting the constitutional rights confirmed in   on trial at the Supreme Court. Max believes that we must codify   into a federal statute, and while in congress Max cosponsored the  , which would do just that. 
 Max was an active member of the Pro-Choice Caucus, and believes that everyone deserves both equal access to reproductive health care, no matter where they live, as well as the right to make personal decisions about their helathcare, and seek abortion care without interference from any politician. He cosponsored the  , to make sure that every woman, no matter what type of insurance they have, or if they're low-income, has the freedom to choose. 
 Max was also proud to advocate for and vote for the for the  , to expand the prohibition against gun possession to those who commit violence against a dating partner. Nearly half of all intimate partner homicides are committed by dating partners. Max introduced and passed a bipartisan amendment to the   that would require domestic violence hotlines to include the voluntary feature of text messaging to ensure all methods of communication are available to those in need so that even when they can’t call, women can always seek help. And he worked with RAINN to reauthorize the  , a federal grant program for state crime labs to finally process the unconsionable backlogs of rape kits. 
 Finally, Max has fought and will continue to fight to ensure that we have equal pay in this country. Women and men should earn an equal income when they are doing equal work—full stop. Today, women who work full time, year-round are paid, on average, only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men, resulting in a gap of over $10,000 each year. On average, Black women are typically paid 63 cents, Native American women 60 cents, Latinas just 55 cents, and Asian American and Pacific Islander women are paid as little as 52 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. This is completely unacceptable. Max was proud to cosponsor and vote to pass the  , which strengthens and closes loopholes in the  , which was passed in 1963 and desperately needs modern updating. The   would finally provide effective remedies to women who are not being paid equal wages for equal work. It also protects against retaliation for discussing salaries with colleagues.Menu

   Rose, who earned a Purple Heart and Bronze Star for his service in Afghanistan, first ran for Congress in 2018. Winning a seat no one thought was possible, Rose vowed to bridge the partisan divide, and get things done for his constituents who had felt like they’d been ignored or ripped off by politicians for years. Over the course of two years, Max was rated as one of the most bipartisan members of Congress in the country. He kept his promise to reject all Corporate PAC and federal lobbyist donations, and secured an impressive list of wins including, but not limited to: permanently funding healthcare for our 9/11 heroes, securing millions of dollars for the opioid epidemic, cutting red tape to kickstart the East Shore Seawall, enacting split-tolling and other key measures to reduce traffic at no extra cost to his constituents, protecting toll discounts, and pioneering an effort to reunite families torn apart by President Trump’s Muslim ban. 
 As Chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Intelligence and Counter-Terrorism, Rose warned about the rising threat of social media radicalization and violent white supremacist organizations. He led the fight to expand the Foreign Terrorist Organization Designation List to include international white supremacist organizations, and led the succesful push for social media companies to establish the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism. 
 When the Pandemic struck, Max ensured that Staten Island and Southern Brooklyn took a back seat to no one. In March 2020, while serving as a member of Congress, Rose successfully advocated for one of New York City’s first drive through testing sites to be placed in his congressional district. He also deployed with the U.S. Army National Guard to assist New York City's coronavirus pandemic response. He is credited with turning a Staten Island psychiatric center into an emergency hospital for patients with COVID-19, successfully leading the advocacy effort to deploy the Comfort Naval Hospital to New York City, and he stood up to both parties in order to bring home billions of dollars in desperately needed COVID relief. 
 Following the 2020 elections, Max served in the Biden Administration as the Senior Advisor on COVID to the Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, responsible for coordinating the Department of Defense’s internal COVID response as well as its support to the national and global effort. For his service in the Pentagon, Max received the Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service, which is the second highest award presented by the Secretary of Defense to non-career Federal employees. 
 Prior to his election to Congress, Rose served as a decorated Army Infantry Officer, deploying to Afghanistan as a Stryker platoon leader. After leaving full-time military service, Rose served as Director of Public Engagement for Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth P. Thompson. Rose led an initiative known as "Begin Again," helping thousands of New Yorkers erase outstanding warrants for minor offenses that were concentrated in underserved areas. Max also served as Chief of Staff at Brightpoint Health, now a member of Sun River Health, providing medical services to the poor and homeless at one of the largest Federally Qualified Health Center systems in New York State. Rose continues his military service today as an Infantry Officer in the New York National Guard. 
 Max Rose graduated from Wesleyan University with a Bachelor's degree in history and earned a Master of Social Science from the London School of Economics. His decorations include the Ranger tab, the Combat Infantryman Badge, a Bronze Star, and a Purple Heart. 
 Max is married to Leigh Byrne, and they are the loving parents of their son, Miles.Menu

   When Staten Islanders and South Brooklynites can barely afford their mortgage payments and healthcare bills, and have egregious daily commute times, Max believes that the government should be on their side, solving these real issues—not on the side of special interests, or billion dollar corporations. That is why Max made good on his commitment to fight corruption tooth and nail in Washington, wherever it may be. 
 He was a proud cosponsor of H.R. 1, the  , one of the strongest anti-corruption and pro-democracy bills ever put forward. This bill strengthens voting access by creating automatic voter registration, streamlining absentee voting, guaranteeing donor disclosure and institutes a system that substantially reduces the corrupting role of money in politics. Max worked to get H.R. 1 passed in the House, but he did not stop there. 
 As one of his first actions in Congress, Max introduced the  , which would ensure that lobbyists operating in the shadows at the bidding of special interests are brought to light. When consultants sell access to government officials under the guise of providing “strategic advice,” the American people deserve to know about it. If you act like a lobbyist—and are paid like a lobbyist—you should have to register as a lobbyist, and that is exactly what would happen under Max’s bill. 
 Max didn’t stop there. Max introduced the bill to end corporate PACs once and for all—the  . This bill prohibits for-profit corporations from being allowed to sponsor, operate, or fund a separate segregated fund, commonly known as a PAC, and would dissolve any existing corporate PAC one year after the bill becomes law. Although special interests hated it and it didn’t pass during his term in congress, Max will continue to fight to ensure that it becomes law. And to prevent Big Pharma from continuing to influence our politics, Max co-authored the Save Lives Act, which bans opioid drug manufacturers’ corporate PACs from supporting federal candidates. 
 No matter the political party, no administration should be allowed to act with impunity when it comes to foreign interests. Max’s   expands the existing financial disclosure requirement for all political appointees, so that all appointees, the President, and the Vice President will need to disclose any positions they or any members of their extended families hold with foreign-owned businesses, along with disclosing foreign intellectual property and significant foreign business stakes owned. Our democracy should be free of foreign interference, now and forever.Menu

   Max believes we can protect our borders and have a immigration system that is fair, functional, and compassionate. 
 NY-11’s rich history of immigrantion and all of its present day immigrant communities represent not just our nation’s beauty, but also its strength. The immigrants of NY-11 and the nation at large are a national asset who are deserving of compassion, respect and equal treatment under the law. Republicans and Democrats need to work together to pass comprehensive immigration reform, modernizing all aspects of our immigration policy including providing a legal pathway for law-abiding undocumented residents to obtain citizenship, most especially our DREAMers who were brought to America as children and have known life in no other country. Max also believes that we can and must do all we can to secure our borders while maintaining our moral compass. Lastly, Max believes that it is absolutely vital that America’s legal immigration system be fully funded, streamlined and strengthened, further enabling America’s competitive economic advantage. 
 Max was a leading advocate in fighting the Travel Ban—which in reality stood as a Muslim Ban—including being an original cosponsor of the  . The Travel Ban targeted Muslims and left military translators and intelligence sources in danger, abandoning our allies in the fight against terrorism. Max helped bring pressure on the Trump administration in fighting the Muslim Ban, challenging the Secretary of Homeland Security at a hearing to demonstrate with facts and data how the Travel Ban has, if at all, prevented terrorist travel into the United States. The Trump Administration was of course unable to do so. Max vociferously advocated for the Yemeni-American citizens in NY-11 who faced hardships with family member’s visa applications due to the Muslim Ban, going as far as formally requesting the Secretary of State to personally approve applications for several constituents. 
 Max consistently sought to protect refugees through the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) Program and the Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) Program as these are refugees who have fled war, natural disasters, and other horrible circumstances. America must continue to be a beacon of hope in a dark world by giving refuge in America to those most in need. Since 1991, thousands of Liberian nationals have been eligible for TPS or DED, which has allowed them to maintain legal immigration status here. Max successfully fought efforts by President Trump to terminate DED status for our Liberian neighbors, protecting Staten Island’s vibrant Liberian community, one of the largest outside of Africa.Menu

   As a U.S. Army combat veteran, and as a former member of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Max is focused on ensuring that we strengthen our sacred commitment to the tens of thousands of veterans in New York’s 11th Congressional District, as well as to all of the nation’s men and women who served. 
 One veteran dying by suicide is too many - but we’ve seen the staggering 20 veterans-per-day statistic persist for far too long. Max set out to change that, and he won’t stop fighting until we end veteran suicides once and for all. In Congress, Max led efforts to increase funding by $5 million for the Veterans Health Administration to hire more mental health professionals, the most-needed occupation according to the VA's Inspector General. And in his first year in office, Max introduced and passed the bipartisan   in response to tragedies of veterans dying by suicide on VA campuses, requiring VA to report to Congress key data points to better understand the scope of the epidemic. 
 Those that put their life on the line for our nation and its people deserve a fierce advocate; Max went to bat for them when in the halls of Congress and will do so again if he is elected. The VA must be fully funded, its staff members must be fully supported, and the VA must be equipped to support 21st Century veterans. This means ensuring VA medical facilities support the significant and growing number of women veterans. That’s why Max introduced the   to have VA medical facilities retrofitted to serve women veterans, which was signed into law. 
 Max also fought for veterans exposed to toxic chemicals through burn pits in the field of combat. Lastly, to provide better care and further combat the overdose epidemic amongst our veterans, Max also introduced legislation to ensure that parents with appointments at VA for substance use or counseling can access VA child care. 
 Keeping in mind that thousands of veterans pursue secondary education after their service, Max fought to put the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for veterans attending college on Staten Island on equal footing with the other four boroughs after years of being treated differently. Max successfully passed a provision in the Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act to increase the BAH for Staten Island, bringing the thousands of service members and student veterans on Staten Island closer to parity than any other Member of Congress had done for our district before.Menu

   Having served in uniform himself, Max knows that our men and women in law enforcement take on unbelievable risks throughout an ordinary workday. Max supports increasing our investment in public safety to ensure our first responders are well-trained, well-paid, well-led and able to meet the demands we place on them. Max wants to see all public safety officials and first responders provided with strong, union backed, middle class salaries and benefits which will enable them to provide for their families in comfort. 
 When it comes to policing, Max believes that law enforcement should be focused on serious violent crime, particularly to address the rise in gun violence in recent years. Max supports Mayor Adam’s efforts to establish a gun violence focused NYPD unit and as Congressman will work to ensure that the NYPD receives the resources it needs to do its job right. During his time in office, Max worked to end the gun violence epidemic, sponsoring a bill signed by President Trump to study the threat of “ghost guns,” dangerous untraceable weapons that have posed a risk to NYPD officers and the general public for years. Max also actively supported the   to close loopholes around background checks and ensure that terrorists, criminals, and domestic abusers cant’ acquire guns. Max supports banning assault weapons, which endanger police and civilians alike and have no place on our street, banning high capacity magazines and bump stocks, passing “Red Flag” laws to keep weapons out of the hands of those with violent intentions, and investing in gun buyback programs to reduce the flow of illegal weapons around the country. 
 As our Congressman, Max helped secure millions in federal Homeland Security Grants to the NYPD and other local law enforcement agencies. He secured $50 million in new counterterrorism funding for the NYPD, as well as an additional $245.5 million in other federal grants to local and state law enforcement. After successfully leading an amendment that increased funding for the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Program by $3 million for Fiscal Year 2020, he continued his leadership and passed an amendment to increase those funds by another $2.5 million for Fiscal Year 2021 so we can support the mental health of first responders. Max also cosponsored the  , which makes it a federal crime to intentionally assault a law enforcement officer while in the process of interstate travel. As the first post-9/11 combat veteran serving New York City in elected office, Max never forgot that our city is on the frontlines of the fight against terrorism. Max strongly supports the NYPD and all of New York’s first responders and is fighting to ensure that they receive the resources they need to keep us all safe. 
 Our NYPD officers, firefighters, and EMTs have put their lives on the line during the COVID-19 pandemic since day one. That’s why Max co-lead legislation to ensure public safety officers who contract the coronavirus while on duty are eligible to receive death and disability benefits, without unnecessary legal hurdles. Ultimately, Max pushed leaders in both parties to get the   signed into law.Menu

   Max believes that Americans deserve a justice system that lives up to the highest ideals of the Constitution, and that more work needs to be done to address the injustices of our past. Max supports a well-trained and well-led police force that enforces the law without bias, as well as additional resources for mental health treatment and social services so that police officers are not responsible for handling a variety of social problems for which they aren’t trained. Furthermore, we must invest in programs that reduce recidivism so that those who’ve paid their debt to society are able to reintegrate and become productive members of society. 
 Policing in America must be held to a high standard of equal protection under the law and police officers must be fairly compensated for the risks that they take everyday to protect us. Max was proud to cosponsor and vote for the  , which would implement long-overdue reforms to our policing and criminal justice system and would bring the rest of the country up to the standards of the NYPD, including: banning chokeholds by police officers, ending racial profiling, and providing resources for police departments nationwide to invest in community policing models. 
 An overwhelming 91% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for recreational or medical use. Despite the acceptance of marijuana across the country, nearly every minute one person is arrested for marijuana possession. Max was proud to vote for the  , which would end the federal criminalization of marijuana and align the public’s view with federal law. Max also strongly supports eliminating sentencing disparities for crack and powder cocaine, which is a racial justice issue. 
 
 , which President Trump signed into law, was a significant criminal justice reform bill that moved towards fairer sentencing, eased mandatory minimum sentences and more. It proved that Democrats and Republicans can come together for criminal justice reform and Max will work to build on its success. 
 Max was also an avid supporter of the LGBTQ community in Congress. He was a cosponsor of The Equality act, which would prohibit discrimination based off gender identity, or sexual orientation in a wide range of public accommodations which include, employment, housing and much more. 
 Additionally Max was one of the leading voices against President Trump’s Transgender ban in the military. As a veteran of the army Max knows that any qualified American who wants to serve this country, should be afforded the opportunity to do so, regardless of their gender identity.Menu

   Max believes the number one priority for our government is to end the pandemic and get our lives back to normal. 
 When COVID-19 hit, Max took action. Max did what few would have done: he deployed with the National Guard during the midst of the storm and stood up a COVID-19 hospital on Staten Island in just days, overseeing the creation of a 262-bed COVID-only field hospital right here in our district. 
 He worked with the state to open the first drive-through testing facility in New York City on Staten Island. He introduced the   to create a new federal lending program so our hospitals and healthcare providers can get the help they need to keep their doors open and recover. And he fought to bring a Navy hospital ship to New York City to treat COVID-19 patients. 
 Max also hires people who get the job done. His staff worked tirelessly to support our constituents when COVID-19 hit, helping them secure small business aid, unemployment benefits, and getting our hospitals, nursing homes and first responders PPE, COVID-19 tests, and more. 
 Max voted to pass the bipartisan  , which provided more than $40 billion to New York, including vital support for first responders and medical workers on the front lines. Additionally, Max led the call for finally using the  to ensure that we have enough PPE, tests, and vaccines. 
 After his time in Congress, Max answered the call once again, serving as a Senior COVID Advisor to the Secretary of Defense at the Pentagon. Max understands that America must build a system of pandemic preparedness that incorporates disease surveillance, expansive testing, global lab networks, and the production onshoring of essential supplies. Max also is fully committed to ensuring that America has the infrastructure in place for the rapid production and distribution of future vaccines, enabling it to respond to future pandemics. He introduced the  , which would establish the Cabinet-level position of Director of Pandemic and Biodefense Preparedness and Response to ensure we’re never unprepared for a pandemic or biological attack again.Menu

   Max served our country in uniform on active duty, in the National Guard where he serves as an Infantry officer, and most recently as Senior Advisor to the Secretary of Defense. Max has seen firsthand that the challenges facing our nation are no longer solely threats from rival nations, but also constitute threats of climate inaction, global terrorism, and foreign attacks on the sanctity of our democratic process. For that reason, Max absolutely supports America’s continued commitment to diplomatic alliances such as NATO, recognizing that our national security can only be ensured through robust American cooperation and leadership on the global and regional stage. 
 Max believes that American global leadership means embracing a foreign policy that puts our national values at its center. In Congress, Max fought for an end to the war in Yemen, an end to China’s treatment of the Uyghurs, and a careful withdrawal from Afghanistan. Max worked to uphold Congress’ sole authority to declare war, and worked to repeal and replace the Authorizations for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) in Afghanistan and Iraq, and ensure that any future armed conflicts are only undertaken with authorization from Congress. Max also supports American leadership through diplomatic and humanitarian assistance to nations in crisis, not only because it is the right thing to do but also because history has shown that when left unaddressed these crisis spots can become hotbeds of extremism and threats to the homeland. 
 As a New Yorker who lived through 9/11 and then fought to bring its perpetrators to justice, Max worked tirelessly to ensure that no terrorist ever threatens Americans again. He advocated for the greater integration of our national counterterrorism capabilities through the Counter Terrorism Advisory Board, worked to sanction Iranian-supported terror groups in Iraq, and forced Twitter to deplatform accounts used by Hamas and Hezbollah to foment terrorism around the world. Max also held social media companies to account for the terrorist content they allow on their platforms, pushing these companies to overhaul their policies for censoring violent conflict online. 
 Max is also a thought leader who first brought attention to the growing threat of violent domestic extremist groups who were responsible for numerous terrorist attacks in Poway, Pittsburg, El Paso, and others. Max spearheaded legislation identifying the threat of transnational white supremacist extremist networks to America and urged the Department of State to designate these groups as Foreign Terror Organizations. Thanks to Max’s work, many of these groups have since disbanded, and countries around the world have worked to disrupt and destroy their networks. 
 Lastly, Max understands that America’s foreign policy has significant economic implications here at home. We cannot sit back and allow nations like China to reap the benefits of a globalized economy at Americans’ expense. Whether it is stealing intellectual property, subsidizing industry, devaluing currency, or conducting active economic espionage, Max stands by the belief that America’s foreign policy must utilize all of the tools at its disposal to punish those nations who employ these harmful tactics. Lastly, Max believes that free trade agreements only work if they are also fair trade agreements and should only be agreed to if they truly benefit America’s workers and also have environmental protections. Partisan divisions cannot stand in the way of this progress, which is why Max actively fought for additional controls against Big Pharma in the NAFTA revision, and then ultimately supported the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement passage once these measures were included.Menu

   As the father of a young child, Max knows how important a child’s early years are to ensuring they can achieve their dreams and live a healthy life in the greatest country on Earth. He also knows that for too many families, childcare overwhelms the family budget or is completely unaffordable. We can change that and put our economy back on the side of parents by creating universal Pre-K, universal childcare, and finally ensuring paid family leave. It is not only the right thing to do, but as the COVID-19 pandemic proved, our economy can’t work without a strong infrastructure to take care of our children. We won’t be able to truly have a thriving economy as long as childcare barriers keep parents who want to work out of the workforce. 
 And he knows that caregiving extends beyond our kids, as so many of us are caring for aging parents too. Max was proud to cosponsor and vote for the   or  , which would create a universal, gender-neutral, national paid family and medical leave program. Under the bill, we’d finally ensure that workers can take up to 12 weeks of paid leave for a pregnancy, the birth or adoption of a child, to recover from a serious illness, or to care for a seriously ill family member. The United States is the only industrialized nation that doesn’t guarantee our workers any form of paid leave. Modeled after successful state programs, the FAMILY Act would create a fund to replace up to 66% of a worker’s wages up to 12 weeks in the event of a serious personal or family medical emergency. Max also supports other efforts to support caregivers like family caregiver tax credit bills to recognize and support not only the emotional and time burden but also the financial hit families face for caregiving for loved ones with disabilities or illnesses. 
 It is also vital that we make long overdue investments in maternal health care and child nutrition. That’s why Max fully supports funding each and every initiative required to ensure that no pregnant woman does not receive the healthcare she needs, especially women of color who face higher risks of maternal mortality. He also supports legislation to ensure every child is able to receive free nutritious meals at school and through summer programs so no child goes hungry.Menu

 To anyone who denies the reality of climate change, Max urges them to come and visit Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn, where you can still see some of the devastation of Hurricane Sandy’s wrath. 
 Max believes that a carbon-free economy must be our North Star. One of the main ways we can reduce pollution and mitigate climate change is to move to a carbon-neutral economy by the year 2040, a goal Max strongly supports. To do so, we need a breakthrough in battery technology to store the renewable energy from solar, wind, and other sources so that we can meet our energy needs while finally moving off fossil fuels. He was a leading voice in congress for America to launch an Apollo Project for batteries and was a proud cosponsor of the  , which directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a “Moon-Shot” Initiative and create pilot projects of grid-scale battery storage technologies to meet aggressive targets for cost, performance, and durability. Max is also a supporter of the continued infrastructure investments and tax policy changes required for a transition away from fossil fuels that does not inflict economic pain on the middle class, but rather reduces their energy bills. 
 Max understands that climate change is a national security threat, which will endanger military bases on coasts and remote areas, and lead to wars over water and other catastrophic potential events. Additionally Max cosponsored the  , which requires the federal government to account for climate change in national security planning as a new and growing threat. 
 Max knows that the next Hurricane Sandy is not an if but when. As Congressman, Max cut through years of red tape to finally get lifted a restrictive easement to allow construction of the East Shore Seawall, which will serve as a life-saving barrier from devastating destruction from rising waters and future hurricanes caused by climate change. We also need to continue to invest in climate resiliency by making significant investments in modernizing our sewer system here on Staten Island and Southern Brooklyn, where Hurricane Ida revealed yet again that we have significant vulnerabilities to significant weather events. 
 
 
 Max will always fight for clear air and clean water - because protecting the environment is essential to our health. Our community has been the victim of polluters and climate change throughout its modern history. For instance, In 2021 as in years past, Staten Island received an "F" in ozone pollution on the American Lung Association’s State of the Air Report. Our district has unusually high rates of asthma, breast cancer, and autism and it is impossible not to acknowledge environmental factors as a cause. The most common Staten Island cancer conditions also consistently rank in the Top 15 cancers caused by 9/11 toxins exposure, according to the World Trade Center Health Program. Max helped lead the charge in Congress to permanently reauthorize the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund so that all of our first responders get the care they need.Menu

   Max has always fought to ensure Americans have access to the healthcare they deserve. Affordable healthcare is not a privilege, it is a right. As someone who helped run non-profit community health centers for the underserved throughout New York City, Max understands what it takes to reform our healthcare system to make it more affordable and more accessible. 
 As a member of Congress, Max took on Big Pharma and insurance companies to work to expand coverage and lower costs for the American people. That’s why he cosponsored and voted for H.R. 3, the  , which would dramatically lower pharmaceutical drug prices for all Americans. He also fully supports permanently expanding and funding subsidies for the   health care marketplace to ensure lower premiums and deductibles for middle class families. He also introduced the  , which would lower out of pocket drug costs for more lower and middle-income seniors. His bill passed the House after it was included in H.R. 3. And Max fought for and will continue to fight to end surprise billing, which happens when people unknowingly get care from providers that are outside of their health plan's network and can happen for both emergency and non-emergency care. 
 To help achieve affordable and universal healthcare coverage, Max supports creating a public healthcare option to force insurance companies to compete for customers as well as lowering the Medicare eligibility age to 55. He also strongly believes we should finally provide dental, vision, and hearing coverage for everyone on Medicare. 
 As our country continues to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, Max understands that we need to be investing in innovative healthcare solutions and our public health infrastructure. As a Member of Congress, Max was a leader in pushing for additional funding for the National Institute of Health to make sure our country’s researchers have the resources to find the treatments and cures of tomorrow. 
 
 
 Over 100,000 Americans died from overdoses in the last 12 months and more will likely die from overdoses in 2022 than COVID. NY-11 has also been one of the epicenters of this horrific crisis. In the face of this, combating the overdose epidemic is one of Max’s top priorities. While in Congress, Max’s bipartisan bill, the  , imposed sanctions on drug manufacturers in China and other nations that produce illicit opioids for traffickers, and on transnational criminal organizations like those in Mexico who traffic fentanyl into the U.S. and as well as on financial institutions that assist them. This important piece of legislation was signed into law and makes it possible for our country to start holding China accountable. 
 Max delivered again for our community when he secured $140 million dollars in increased funding for opioid prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts following his bipartisan push. Max understands that in order to counter the overdose crisis, America must invest in a new, bold and comprehensive strategy to end the opioid epidemic - one that uses predictive analytics and innovative computing to identify and seek out our neighbors who are most likely to overdose so peer mentors and caring medical professionals can intervene to save their life. This outreach needs to be combined with the evidence-based care we know works including medications for opioid use disorder, narcan distribution, substance use disorder counseling, behavioral health services, and work to address underlying causes of addiction that all too often contribute to personal overdose crises and needless deaths.Menu
